      "selftext": "I was shocked when I saw the benefits made by the Swiss Central Bank during the euro peg crisis (38B $) and asked myself a silly question. Why isn't Switzerland in this list?\n\n-> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_sovereign_wealth_funds\n\nAs you probably know, a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is a state-owned investment fund investing in real and financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, or in alternative investments such as private equity fund or hedge funds. Switzerland is said to be the 20th richest country in the world. The authorities should easily be able to manage a successful and profitable SWF, especially if it was built on their dividends taken from SNB annual profits.\n\n525,3 Milliarden Franken ....\n\n>Schweiz druckte aggressiver als alle anderen Geld\nWie stark die Interventionen waren, macht die Bilanzsumme der SNB deutlich. Diese hat sich seit Beginn der Maßnahmen im Jahr 2011 monströs aufgebläht. Mit 525,3 Milliarden Franken ist sie mehr als drei Mal so groß wie 2008. Damit haben die schweizerischen Währungshüter im Verhältnis fast genauso viel \"Geld gedruckt\" wie die amerikanische Federal Reserve (Fed).[1]\n\nHad they invested that into shares, we'd own half of europe by now. \n\nWe could take, for example, 10% of SNB annual dividends and transfer them in 5 funds.\n\n* infrastructure fund (Gotthard tunnels, SBB, highways etc.)\n* strategic ressources fund (oil, food, refineries, etc.)\n* redistribution fund (to be shared with the population if needed, for example ahv-iv)\n* financial emergency fund (not to be touched before financial crises)\n* sovereign investment fund\n\nLater, those funds would be managed by the an authority under the control of the National Assembly and could only be opened after a popular vote. Imagine how much we could reduce taxes and how better would our infrastructures become, if we had created such a fund in the 80's. Look at Singapore or even at Norway, our harsh opponent of the North. ...\n\nWhy don't we have some of those useful funds? :(\n",

      "selftext": "Hello /r/Switzerland,\n\nHope you're having a great weekend!  This will probably be the last post before I head to Switzerland, next week.  I want to thank everyone that has responded to my previous posts, but an extra shout out to /u/audiohound46 for providing me with great details and answering my questions!\n\nI've done a good amount of research on this sub and other various websites (Rick Steves and Wikitravel).  For those of you researching Switzerland, I found these threads to be very helpful:\n\n* http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/33t2wn/where_are_switzerlands_biggest_tourist_traps/\n* http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/3089ta/rswitzerland_what_are_some_nice_restaurants_in/\n\nand of course the stickied thread for visiting Switzerland:\n\n* http://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/2ml8qp/so_you_want_to_visit_switzerland/\n\nBefore I post my itinerary, I have some basic (non-basic?) questions:\n\n1.  I have a 15-day Swiss Travel Pass - How can I get the most out of it?  I understand museum (all?) admission is free?  Also, some \"special\" trains such as the Golden Round Trip is 50% off, correct?\n\n2. Which banks or ATMs are safest to use in Switzerland?  I plan on withdrawing CHF as soon as I land in Zurich airport, do I need to be careful of certain ATMs?\n\n3. What are some good lunch recommendations within Zurich airport?  I will have to take the train to Appenzell as soon as I land, and I'm sure I will be hungry.\n\n\n\n\nMy Itinerary:\n\n**First leg (1 night) - Appenzell**:\n\nFly into Zurich in the morning, buy a Swisscom simcard, grab a quick bite, then head to Appenzell.\nI will stay in Appenzell for one night.  I planned on hiking this trail:\n\nhttp://www.ebenalp.ch/de/sommer/wanderkarte/route-8 (the forecast says that it will rain, but that won't stop me from hiking!)\n\nI'm sure it will be foggy and cloudy, but I will try to head to St. Gallen during the evening for a stroll around town.  \n\n**Second leg (3 nights) - Lucerne**:\n\nHead to Lucerne in the afternoon; if the weather permits, I will walk around to see the usual attractions (I can skip the lion).  If the weather is still permits the next day, I will get on the Golden Round Trip.  All the attractions and and must-see was taken from wikitravel and a lonely planet book.  I've taken into account of all the tourist traps; can you recommend me something that *I CAN'T MISS in Lucerne?!*  Thank you!\n\n**Third leg (4 nights) - Berne**:\n\nThis is probably the most complicated leg of my trip; I will be taking day trips from Berne to other parts of Switzerland.  I've scratched off Zermatt and Jungfraujoch off the list after a lot of consideration.  I would rather save the money and time to go somewhere else.  Again, all the basic attracions and must-see were taken from the fore mentioned resources.  \n\nI plan on visiting Murten and Aveches after seeing everything in Berne.  I also plan on taking day trips from Berne to the following:\n\n* Interlaken / Thun - this can be done in one day, correct?  I know how touristy Interlaken is and how people are underwhelmed, I don't have high expectations, *but is there a \"must-see?\"* in Interlaken and Thun?\n\n* Hiking in Grimmelwald / Murren - Hopefully the weather permits\n\n* Lauterbrunnen Valley / Schilthorn - Trümmelbach Falls & Staubbach Falls - Can this be done in one day with the above?(Grimmelwald / Murren)\n\n**Fourth and final leg (3 nights) - Geneva**\n\nThe usually must-see and attractions in Geneva, again, *what can I NOT miss to see in Geneva*?  I will also be taking a few day trips from Geneva to:\n\n* Montreux - Château de Chillon, Marmots' Paradise, Riviera Promenade, Montreux Vieille Ville\n* Lausanne - *Suggestions?*\n* Lake Geneva - *Suggestions?*\n\n1. Is there anything else to be recommended for a day trip from Geneva?\n2. What do you think of my itinerary?  Where can I improve?\n\nAgain, thank you so much for taking the time to read thru my post!\n\n**EDIT** I forgot the ask the most important question!  What is a good Swiss brand chocolate that I can bring back to my friends and family?  I don't have money to bring back any Pateks, but what are some notable chocolates that won't cost too much?  Thank you!\n\n",

I also don't remember noticing a third-gender option in any of the official forms (banks, insurances, kreisburo, etc..) that I have come across in the past 3-4 years. \n\nAny info in this regard is much appreciated.\n\nNote: On google, I came to know of the [transgender network](http://www.transgender-network.ch/) which works for the rights of transgenders in Switzerland.\n",

While we regret any inconvenience this may cause, from 26 December 2018 customers shopping on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) and other non-EU Amazon websites will not be able to ship non-digital orders to any shipping address in the Swiss Customs Union. We encourage all our customers shipping orders to a delivery address in the Swiss Customs Union to shop on Amazon websites in the EU ([Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de), [Amazon.fr](https://Amazon.fr), [Amazon.it](https://Amazon.it), [Amazon.es](https://Amazon.es), [Amazon.co.uk](https://Amazon.co.uk)) to access millions of products across multiple categories, including books, fashion, toys, and electronics.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>With the change of the international shopping options, we regrettably will not be able to transfer unused gift card balances to Amazon websites in the EU. Therefore, all customers who have outstanding funds on their non EU Amazon accounts are kindly requested to utilize them before 26 December 2018. After that date, you will still be able to buy digital products such as apps and Kindle books with your outstanding balance.   \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Thank you for choosing to shop with Amazon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is, unless you've got some trick up your sleeve, you've got until December 26th to get whatever you may want from [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) shipped to a Swiss address. This may not be the first source, but after reading a few sites it definitely explains things in the easiest to understand way: [https://www.englishforum.ch/finance-banking-taxation/288425-purchasing-amazon-com.html](https://www.englishforum.ch/finance-banking-taxation/288425-purchasing-amazon-com.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally I find this irritating, yet another instance of law makers making life harder for citizens, at least on the short term. I am far from understanding the greater implications for the economy (Swiss, European, etc.) and can only *hope* it plays out well for The Greater Good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, this isn't just about Amazon, it looks like it will affect all retailers that (used to) ship to Switzerland. Including all the small sites that aren't (and can't afford becoming) prepared to comply with the new law. Looks like there is a clause that would small retailers, but I don't have much hope that they will use it; I expect most of them will just stop shipping to Switzerland, Just In Case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShopping from foreign retailers has its uses, not everything you may want (or need) can be found in Switzerland, or even in Europe. Most recently I had to resort to Amazon USA for an out-of-print board game and a specific USB WiFi adapter. Previously, something as simple as a medium-size screwdriver with magnetic tip proved impossible to find (even searching in German), and when a book just comes out and the only way to get is in dead-tree format and from the USA... well, what do we do now? I don't have a car, I haven't been to Germany or even Basel more than a couple times in nearly a decade, so what tricks may I have left to try? And most importantly, how will/may Swiss Custom deal with old and new tricks?",

I don't have a  huge salary, around 80k per year gross, not sure what it is net, I work near Lausanne  and live about 45km from there. Here's what I'm doing so far:\n\n* I own my flat in a PPE (flat in a building with shared administration cost) , so I guess I'm saving money compared to renting, the PPE charges are quite high though (450 chf a month) but I do save money compared to a similar squared footage flat in the city.\n* I do commute a lot everyday by car but use an economic car, probably costs me around 200 CHF on fuel each month but the car is already paid for.\n* I try to put in each year the max on my 3eme pilier (is it around 6700 chf?), anyway I always put the max. But in ten years that's 67'000, this will be gone very quickly when I'm retired and have no income right?\n* I don't spend more than half of my salary each month, that's including everything (taxes, insurance, vacation, etc..). To be precise not more than 2400 CHF.\n\nThe bad part:\n\n* I know my \"2eme pillier\" at work is one of  the lowest in Switzerland.\n* I don't fully understand the AVS system, all I know is I had a few years living with my own money without working and not paying AVS at all, not sure what that implies.\n\nFor the moment I have 40k that I could invest somewhere, it's just sitting on my bank account. Every month I get half of my salary into it and was wondering how I could \"safely\" invest into something long term to help me prepare for the future. On a sidenote, I'm ok living a simple life and plan to retire early, I don't live a high profile life and value time more than money.\n\n\n\nShould I save for another property, stock , or something else that I'm not aware of?\n\nAny tips or advice are welcome, thanking you in advance for your feedback.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your feedback and great advice , this will help me investigate further on my situations.",

I work as an engineer and my gf in import/export of dangerous materials. \n\nCurrently the life in Israel with its massive government intervention in citizen life makes our life quite hard. I cannot imagine EVER owning a house of my own even though we both work. The only way is to be in debt for the next 30 years at least, basically being a slave for the bank or government \"benefits\" if you are a proffesional moocher.\n\nI absolutely LOVE switzerland and my visit there last year made me love the country even more.\nWe decided a few months ago that we want to make a life there (here for you I guess :) ). We are studying German in the Goethe institute in Tel-Aviv and quite enjoy it. Although when I hear Swiss-German I cannot understand a word. \n\nThe biggest concern for me is how the hell do I find a job from abroad. I cannot afford first moving to Switzerland and then finding a job. I have to find a job from Israel, if that is even possible. I posted my Resume in monster.ch and even applied for two jobs- got rejected two days later. (Hey, at least they TELL you you didn't get the job unlike here where you get an answer after a few months or usually not at all).\nI can have a Romanian passport because my grandparents are from there, but I am not sure its a sure thing.\nI simply LOVE the economic freedom in Switzerland that leaves the US and almost any other country far behind, and Israel far, far behind.\n\nI really hope we are able to start a life in Switzerland. Actually, I feel like my life is now \"frozen\" until I will arrive at this place where people can actually work and save money to allow them to live, and not just survive, or at least not give half of their earnings to the government.\n\nI'm soon 35, I hope I am not too old to start the process.\n\nWell, that's the end of me whining. I really hope to succeed!\n\nIf there's anyone here that managed to find a job in Switzerland from abroad, please share some tips. If you were an engineer with a beginner level German it will be very encouraging!",

I'm getting very tired having left my family, and girlfriend of 4 years, behind in England and staying in my flat is driving me a bit crazy. The first thing I noticed about Geneva, and Switzerland is how expensive everything is! My first month was a record spend and painful on the poor old bank account. Since then I have been nudging it down slowly, with decisions such as the year long travelcard for under 25's, but it still feels real pricey. Sometimes up to 100CHF/week in just food if I'm not careful. I'd like to be going out more and doing things but I'm terrified of how much it might cost me! CERN pay well, but I'm booking semi-regular flights home to England and it strains money quite tight sometimes.\n\nSo, any tips of good stuff to do that doesn't hold a massive price tag? I was at the Escalade race and celebration the week after which were great fun. Do more things like that happen that I should miss? If so, when? I'm a big snowboarding fan, but again, unsure of how to do this without spending too much here. Haven't been for a while but if there are some clubs and such I'd love to be involved. Cheers for any info, its much appreciated.\n\nIf there are some \"must see\" or \"must do\" things that do cost money I'm not opposed to spending it, so do include them too. It'll just be one of those special occasions I spread out a bit :)",

I know Switzerland is known for their banking but it is hard finding literature on the internet about their Mortgage industry and the jobs associated with it. I really like what I do, and would like to continue doing it. If anyone could provide insight, I would really appreciate that :) I feel that my girlfriend could probably find a job in the health industry without tremendous difficulty, but if I am wrong in this assumption please correct me. \n\nI appreciate all feed back :) Feel free to post links to blogs, and literature that may be helpful. \n\nThank you everyone!!\n\nEDIT: To clarify, we do not want to emigrate. Our plan is to be there 3-5 years. We just want to get our taste of Europe while we are young :)\n\nEDIT #2: Girlfriend and I will likely be Married before we even begin this process \n\n****THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE KIND RESPONSES, I REALLY APPRECIATE IT****",

      "selftext": "Hi all! I've recently (2 weeks ago to be exact) moved to Zürich. My German is almost non-exestent, I learned some of it back at elementary school so I can get by if I really need to, although I rely on English for now. \n\nI'd like to focus on High German first and not confuse myself with dialects. However, my problem is that I can't for sure say if somebody is speaking to me in High or Swiss German. So is it something you speak only at home, work, with friends or everywhere including services (shops, restaurants) banks, administartive departements etc.? If so, I assume people would switch to High German if they see me (badly) speaking that? I don't know any locals yet so I only come to contact with them if I'm shopping or running errands. \n\nOne last thing since I like to at least say greetigs in local language. I know Grüezi, I've seen people to say Hallo as well. Guten Tag is not a thing here? For goodbye I use Auf Wiedersehen and again heard Tschüs. Are Hallo and Tschüs more informal? I think I heard something else as well but didn't catch that. Also few people said merci instead of danke to me, so you say that in German speaking part of Switzerland as well? Sorry for stupid questions, I just like to have at least my greeting game on point if I don't speak the language :)",

She phoned UBS to know what's up with the transfer and they said it can take 7 to 10 days to come back if the transfer didn't work... and they offer to go further on the investigation but she will have to pay a 30.- fee... what a poor customer service (to be expected from UBS anyway but still)\n\nSo did anyone have any experience about how to cancel a transfer, or any other troubles with TWINT?

She said that she forgot which account was connected with her TWINT account, and then checked the bad account and didn't see the transaction.

What?! She couldn't quite explain in English and went on talking about \"capital\" and told me she would check back in with me when she could explain in a language we both understand. Now, I'm coming into this from a background of 15-year and 30-year mortgages, where yes the bank robs you with interest, but after these initial periods you ultimately \"own\" your home and can leverage against its current market value, or sell it.\n\nCan anyone expand on this Swiss idea of the bank always owning your home for this very confused American who hopes to set up shop in CH one day? How are mortgages set up over there, etc?\n\nEdit: Very insightful everyone, thanks. Basically- vive la banque/franc! ",

In just the last 8 weeks:\n\n- I've had to order *years* worth of transaction records, hundreds of sheets of paper, to verify single item incomes and outgoings on my savings account, since the online transaction search services don't track transactions older than 2 years.\n\n- I've been repeatedly unable to perform transactions due to the need to input the codes from that stupid card calculator device to verify the recipients in trying to send money to\n\n- Trying to move money between two accounts, and not only being prevented by the calculator recipient verification, but also having the transaction take so long the balance for the transfer becomes unavailable due to my estranged wife spending my savings, and the transaction being stuck in 'pending' as a result of the delay.\n\n- I've been repeatedly told that the Access application issues alerts for transaction verifications, when it hasn't, and that I need to uninstall and reinstall it if it's not working; and having gone through the laborious process of setting up the Access app again, still no notifications\n\n- trying to figure out the e-banking service to determine why multiple sets of transactions are being sent to the same recipient (my insurer) when we only have two policies. This has been going on for months, no one can tell me why.\n\nI need suggestions for a modern, efficient online bank with technology dating from this millennia preferably, which can provide me a proper level of control over my funds.

Because we were both nervous on our first date, we didn’t take a picture or anything of this awesome day.  \nBut as we were sitting on the bench in the \"Stadtgarten Winterthur\" a couple walked to us and asked us if they could ask us some questions and film our answers.  \nThey told us that their daughter soon will have a marriage. For this they want to ask couples what they think about her daughter and her becoming husband. They showed a picture of them and asked what we think, where they from and what their job could be.  \nThan they told us that she is from around here (Winterthur). He is from Sri Lanka and has brown skin (not meant to be racist). And she is a therapist (or psychiatrist, I’m not 100% sure).\n\nNow I really hope to find a way to contact them because this video from our 1. date would be a great surprise for my girlfriend.  \nTheir marriage was shortly after the 25.01.2017 (maybe somewhere between February and April) in Winterthur (as far as I know). And they recorded us in the \"Stadtgarten Winterthur\" while sitting on the bench (47°30’03.9\"N, 8°43’47.3\"E).  \nI multiple times called the \"Zivilstand\" (+41 52 267 57 66) and the \"Hochzeitsregister\" (+41 52 267 57 65). But they said they don’t have time for this. If I had a name or something they could help. (Sadly I don’t know any name.)  \nI also tried to find a webcam showing this place at this time to find some more informations.\n\nDoes someone have an idea where I could find a list of the marriages from Winterthur? When someone dies you can find this in magazines and on other places. Is there something similar for marriages (maybe in a church)? Or does someone know a person working for the \"Zivilstand\" of Winterthur?\n\nAny ideas are welcome!  \nThank you very much!!!\n\nKindly Regards,  \nPhotelegy  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n**The same Text in German:**  \n\n\nHallo zusammen,\n\nIch habe eine Idee für eine Überraschung für meine Freundin.  \nIch hoffe, ihr habt ein paar Ideen, um das im folgenden Text beschriebene Überraschungsvideo zu finden.\n\nWir hatten unser erstes Date am 25.01.2017 nachmittags in Winterthur (Schweiz) und sind nun seit fast 4 Jahren glücklich zusammen. Da wir beide bei unserem ersten Date nervös waren, haben wir kein Foto oder ähnliches von diesem tollen Tag gemacht.  \nAber als wir auf der Bank im Stadtgarten Winterthur sassen, kam ein Paar auf uns zu und fragte uns, ob sie uns ein paar Fragen stellen und unsere Antworten filmen dürften.  \nSie erzählten uns, dass ihre Tochter bald heiraten wird. Dazu wollen sie Paare fragen, was sie über ihre Tochter und ihren zukünftigen Ehemann denken. Sie zeigten ein Bild von ihnen und fragten, was wir denken, woher sie kommen und was ihr Beruf sein könnte.  \nDann haben sie uns gesagt, dass sie von hier (Winterthur) ist. Er kommt aus Sri Lanka und braune Haut hat (nicht rassistisch gemeint). Ausserdem ist sie Therapeutin (oder Psychiaterin, ich bin mir nicht mehr 100% sicher). \n\nJetzt hoffe ich wirklich, dass ich einen Weg finde, sie zu kontaktieren. Denn dieses Video von unserem 1. Date wäre eine tolle Überraschung für meine Freundin.  \nIhre Hochzeit war kurz nach dem 25.01.2017 (vielleicht irgendwo zwischen Februar und April) in Winterthur (soweit ich weiss). Und sie haben uns im \"Stadtgarten Winterthur\" auf der Bank sitzend gefilmt (47°30'03.9 \"N, 8°43'47.3 \"E).  \nIch rief mehrmals beim \"Zivilstand\" (+41 52 267 57 66) und beim \"Hochzeitsregister\" (+41 52 267 57 65) an. Aber sie sagten, sie hätten keine Zeit für so etwas. Wenn ich einen Namen oder etwas anderes hätte, könnten sie helfen. (Was ich leider noch nicht habe.)  \nIch habe auch versucht, eine Webcam zu finden, die diesen Ort zu dieser Zeit zeigt, um mehr Informationen zu erhalten.\n\nHat jemand eine Idee, wo ich eine Liste der Eheschliessungen/Heirat von Winterthur finden könnte? Wenn jemand stirbt, kann man das ja in Zeitungen und an anderen Stellen finden. Gibt es etwas ähnliches für Eheschliessungen (vlt. auch bei der Kirche)? Oder kennt jemand eine Person, die für den \"Zivilstand\" von Winterthur arbeitet? \n\nJede Idee ist willkommen!  \nHerzlichen Dank!!! \n\nMit freundlichen Grüßen,  \nPhotelegy",

Well, I have a conflicting appointment so I needed to change. I called them. Here's the conversation.\n\nMe: (greetings and then) I am afraid I need to reschedule.\n\nAssistant: \"We usually don't even see patient on Wednesdays. This is a special appointment\"\n\nMe: I understand but I have a conflicting business meeting.\n\nAssistant: You must cancel the conflicting appointment. We will be on vacation after this.\n\nMe: Vacation, again? Ok. when will he be available?\n\nAssistant: August 29th.\n\nMe: (burst out into a nervous laughter)\n\nAssistant: This is not funny.  Can you come on 14th, yes or not!?\n\nMe: No I can not.....\n\nAssistant: Ok.  Good bye.\n\nAnd she hung up on me. \n\nWhoa.... Not only she told me how I mange my job, proceeded to tell me how I am supposed to feel, and then \"take of leave it\" ultimatum and hung up. What are they? A rock star? A God?\n\nOr how about this. I contacted my bank saying their online banking was in a way, I couldn't see an important details so suggested to change.  The person basically said \"This is how it is, we are not gonna change it.\"  Well I guess many people must have complained because 2-3 months later, it was changed as exactly I had suggested.  \n\nWhat's about this \"default no\" culture here. Every thing is \"No\" first.  \"No, we will not change because we know what we are doing and this is how it is.\"  That's not how a person ( or a company) grows, isn't it?\n\nI am so fed up with how overall experiences in Switzerland when it comes to contacting \"businesses\". They still run business with telephones. Are we still in 80s? They don't reply emails. If they do, it takes a week to do so. They are absolutely rude to the point, as a customer, I feel like I need to beg to provide me their services.  I have been trained to become joyful when Digitec actually reply to my inquiry emails. How pathetic is this?? \n\nWhat's worse is, I am getting ruder and ruder as \"do as Romans do\". And I hate it.\n\nEdit 1: thanks for some replies I am getting better picture. A Redditor said France is worse.  Another said Italy is worse.  When surrounded by worse countries, no insensitive to improve  because Switzerland is better ;)",

Especially as I am one of those evil anti-smoking expats that the community at 20min warned you about. \n\n[Originally posted here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/j0rour/a_few_more_thoughts_and_experiences_after_5_years/).\n\n**EDITED** I clarified a few points that came up in the comments. So if a comment looks like they didn't read the text they actually did.\n\n---\n\nIt is now just over 5 years since I (32/male) moved from the UK to Switzerland. There have been many surprises along the way. I moved here with a 1 year temporary contract and had vague plans to work, see the country at weekends, and then move on elsewhere after. During this time I have moved house, moved job, been unemployed for a few months, explored the country, met and worked with Swiss people from various parts of the country and Expats of various backgrounds, oh and gotten married to a Swiss person.\n\nThis is not an all out guide (there are plenty of those), more my reflections and a few lessons learned.\n\nI have posted before [after 1 year]( https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/3x3hkn/i_moved_to_switzerland_here_are_a_few_thoughts_on/) and [after 2.5 years]( https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/7ng3j3/i_got_out_i_moved_to_switzerland_25_years_ago/).I have also written pretty extensively about travelling here and Switzerland in general – [an overview post of all that is here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/85jbdn/resources_for_switzerland/).\n\n\n---\n\n**---Resources---**\n\n I came in knowing practically nothing other than a frantic check of anything I needed to do to avoid being kicked out.\n\n* The book “*Living and Working in Switzerland : A Survival Handbook*” by David Hampshire, is very useful.\n\n* Various dedicated websites with more serious official information [sem.admin.ch](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen.html), and [Ch.ch](https://www.ch.ch/en/living-switzerland-foreign-national/), and to an extent websites like [SwissInfo]( https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/basics_earning-a-living--working-in-switzerland/44528288).\n\n* Various websites with more unofficial but helpful information. The [EnglishForum.ch]( https://www.englishforum.ch/) is a treasure trove of information and experiences. But there are endless other places like [Newlyswissed]( https://www.newlyswissed.com/), and [Swiss and Chips]( https://swissandchips.com/) that vary between useless fluff and very useful info.\n \n---\n\n**---Why and how---**\n\n* I did a PhD in the UK and as I was finishing it up and looking for a PostDoc I basically just got a job here in a place I had never heard of through chance by a chain of contacts. I had been looking to move abroad but for some reason Switzerland had never occurred to me.\n\n* Initially I arrived on a 1 year contract with Firm A, with the strong likelihood of it being extended to 2 years. It ended up as 2.5, by which time I was moved in with my girlfriend and I was set on sticking around. Job hunting was slower than I expected, so before starting on a new position at Firm B I applied to unemployment benefits for what turned out to be just a month (not sure I need to be so secretive really, but why not). \n\n* I basically just moved with my laptop and as much clothing as I could fit in a 60L backpack. I didn’t bother/forgot to declare anything (not that I brought anything of any value with me).\n\n* I got lucky with housing, but that could have been the biggest problem. Initially I had been expecting to stay at a flat rented by the company for a month or two until I found my own place. This got cancelled at the last minute and I found myself trying to find a flat to move straight into. In the end I staying at a hostel for a week and moved into a shared flat found through [WGzimmer.ch]( https://www.wgzimmer.ch/) before the end of the week. There are not many shared flats where you can quickly jump in compared to the UK, and applying for a flat of your own often feels more like applying for a job or dating with the process dragging on for much longer than the “You like it? OK pay the deposit and sign here” method in the UK. Starting early and getting help from your company is certainly advisable there. The only time I ever use my Dr title is on job and housing applications.\n\n---\n\n**---Bureaucracy, Rules, and Paperwork---**\n\nI had feared this would be a slow and complicated torture, but to date this has all been very quick, easy, and painless. In large part probably because I had a job already, I was an EU citizen, and I had an address lined up quickly. I know it gets more complicated for non-EU citizens.\n\n* Dealing with the local authorities has always been fast, efficient, and friendly. Other than collecting my residency permit every so often when a contract has been renewed I have only had to deal with them very periodically, but any phone call or visit has taken no more than 20 minutes with very little waiting. This might just be because I live in a small city – maybe in Zürich or a tiny village it is different.\n\n* I had a slight delay in getting my permit and bank account activated as I waited for the landlord to approve my place as subtenant and give me a contract for proof of address (despite the fact I was already living there). This didn’t create any problems, my firm just gave me an envelope stuffed with bank notes for my first payment.\n\n* Setting up a PostFinance bank account was easy (even with a language barrier then). 20 minutes of filling in a form and showing a few documents. \n\n* Despite the reputation for rules and order I have not noticed much difference to life in other industrialised western countries. If anything it is more relaxed in many ways. There are some stricter rules like having to use pre-taxed bin bags or minimal noise on a Sunday, but these are mostly reasonable enough. It is nice not hear endless lawn mower engines on a Sunday afternoon. [The only rule that seems pointless is having to tie up paper in a perfect bundle for recycling]( https://www.homeschwiizhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_1307.jpg). Maybe if I ever try and build a house or plan an extension the rules will get more complex and painful.\n\n* You are supposed to swap your driving licence within a year, or unable to drive in Switzerland and be made to repeat the test again if you want a Swiss licence. I didn’t apply at first given that I never intended to drive here or stay much longer at first. When I did apply after 2.5 years through the standard process (just to see what would happen) I actually did just get given a Swiss licence without being asked to go through the whole testing process.\n\n* The mandatory health insurance is easy enough to set up with all the big companies offering English support. I have mostly done the bare minimum I need to do here and have yet to start being truly Swiss and chasing the best deal every year. The cost is painful, but the health care system has always been efficient and effective for me.\n\n* Tax was originally paid at the source (as is standard for foreign workers up until you are on a C permit) which made life very easy there, but now being married and treated as a combined legal entity I am paying tax through the standard method.\n\n* Going through the marriage process was also easy. Being an EU citizen marrying a Swiss citizen helped. There was some confusion when they asked for a statement from the UK govt saying I was not married as this apparently has not been given out in years, but a quick chat resolved that problem. A British friend who married a non-resident Russian had a much harder time.\n\n---\n\n**---Money---**\n\n* I make roughly 100k CHF per year. This is more than decent by Swiss standards. Given my education and experience I could get more in another firm/position here, but I am happy with my workplace and would be very reluctant to give up my scenic riverside commute by bike.\n\n* Saving money has not been a problem. Even bearing most of the household costs with a studying partner. Not having a car, pets, kids, or eating/drinking out much helps there. My main non-essential expense is the general train pass and food/accommodation costs for weekends around the country.\n\n* The high prices take some getting used to at first, but when you work here it isn’t so bad (once you learn to stop converting them back to your native currency). The positive side is that when you leave Switzerland everything is suddenly so cheap.\n\n---\n\n**--- The Swiss ---**\n\nI like the Swiss.\n\n* I have never had any problems with the Swiss; despite the number of comments I see online bemoaning the fact that whilst Switzerland is a beautiful country it would be terrible to live in as the locals hate foreigners. I have never had a moment of hostility and experience less general rudeness than I would expect back home in the UK (even with language/culture barriers to push the patience).\n\n* I am however white, from a north-western European country which doesn’t have many expats in Switzerland, and educated (outside the expense of the Swiss people). So I am probably not going to be the target of much racism or xenophobia. \n\n* Whilst not the warmest people in the world there is a certain friendliness, especially in informal situations. Put a Swiss person in the countryside and they will be friends with anyone. In rural restaurants especially sharing a table with strangers and saying hello/goodbye to everyone there as a whole is standard practice.\n \n* I am amazed by how relaxed and trusting they can be. Once for example whilst eating outside at a quiet restaurant I asked for the bill and a coffee, the owner left the restaurant wallet on the table with me and went to get the coffee. Likewise I went to a bike shop I had never been in before, said I was interested in quickly testing a 3000 CHF mountain bike and they just handed it over and told me to have fun - no request for ID or anything.\n\n* I am also more on the introverted side so a quieter and orderly country is probably more my sort of place than some of the commenters.\n\n---\n\n**---Making friends---**\n\nMy friendship group is a mix of Swiss and other expats. It is easier to integrate with other expats, though I find that the younger generations of Swiss are much more open than the old jokes of knowing a Swiss person from birth or for 40 years to be their friend would suggest.\n\nMoving in with a Swiss man of my age right away made this much easier. I basically got an instant friend and guide to all things Swiss. \n\n---\n\n**---Language---**\n \n[I have written fairly extensively about Swiss-German before]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/9levnb/my_experience_dealing_with_swissgerman_for_those/). Though I do like Swiss-German and I much prefer High-German with a Swiss accent to the standard German High-German.\n\n* I had some very basic German in the distance past from school. Then started learning before I arrived. Now I am B2/C1 with German and (very slowly) working towards A2 with French, with the aim of having at least some very basic Italian.  \n\n* Oddly even living in a German speaking area it can be hard to use it, especially now not being out and about much. My work is in English and it is conducted between workers in German or whatever language most people in the meeting speak (which is typically English), my home life is mostly English as I met my wife when I didn’t speak much German and we got too used to speaking English together.\n\n* I didn’t need to get a language certificate (still don’t really). Partly I put it off thinking I would wait until the next level, and partly that the grammar and me are not friends. In the end the updated rules for my canton meant I needed evidence of my language skills to get a C permit rather than just staying on the B. So I have finally taken and passed the TELC B2 exam for German which more than covers everything I need (including citizenship). Long term I am thinking about aiming for certificates for C1 in German, B1 in French, and A2 in Italian – but those would just be to help set goals rather than be requirements.\n\n* The Swiss are very patient with language. I got one or two comments from shop workers that I should learn German if I was going to live here at first – but nothing that felt like it had any bad intention or resentment to it. If anything I have a problem getting the Swiss to speak German with me, many of them will switch to English as soon as they get a hint of my accent. I expect that in a touristy area like Interlaken, but it happens everywhere from the butcher to a remote farmhouse restaurant in the Jura. I am never quite sure if they are being polite, want to practise their English, or can't stand the idea of dealing with High-German.\n\n* As noted above English is very widely spoken. \n\n* If you live in a city and work in an international workplace then knowing the local language isn’t really needed. Once you have a flat and bank account all the interaction you need is self-service machines at the supermarket (and even those you can set to English). Though I certainly don’t recommend doing that.\n\n* It is natural to think that everyone here speaks German/French/Italian fluently (and maybe some Romansch), but that is far from the case. Some do have all 3, many are fluent in 2, but very often English is the preferred common language outside of their mother tongue. Likewise the way the language regions tend to have very hard borders without much overlap was a bit surprising at first. I often find that French speakers would rather (or can only) speak English rather than German.\n\n* Being in a country with multiple languages will never get boring. Especially somewhere that actually is bilingual like Biel where it isn’t uncommon for a shopkeeper to forget what language they were speaking to you in and switch from German to French.\n\n---\n\n**---Surprises---**\n\n* Those bastard fancy landscape photos didn’t show the fog did they? From September to February temperature inversion means that [much of the low lying middle of Switzerland can be sat in/under a thick fog](https://i.imgur.com/E0UhJ8s.jpg). How bad this is varies by location; some places barely get any whilst others turn into Silent Hill for weeks on end. Already shorter winter days can be shortened by hours as the light is swallowed. The plus side is that above the fog you get super clear views, but it gets depressing after days of daily life sat inside it.\n\n* The country is much livelier than I expected. The stereotype of a grey serious place might have been true decades ago but certainly isn’t now. Especially in summer there are constant music festivals, lively bars, and flotillas of people floating down the rivers in inflatable flamingos. Granted it still isn’t Latin America. \n\n* I was not prepared for Swiss-German, my then basic German knowledge didn’t stand a chance. [I have been working on this and managed to put together as comprehensive collection of resources as you are likely to find anywhere for Swiss-German]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ali_on_switzerland/comments/abiz2i/resources_for_learning_swissgerman/).\n\n* Sometimes it feels like being back in time. Shops close early (or don’t open at all on Sunday) and at some cinemas they pause the film and have a 10 minute intermission. Things that went away in the UK before I was born.\n\n* The Swiss love to shake hands. For me they are something for the first time you meet someone, or maybe for professional acquaintances you see infrequently. Not for everyone in your group of friends at the start and end of the evening. Kids shaking hands with the teacher everyday is still a strange concept to me.\n\n* The Swiss see summer as BBQ season in a way that makes the Aussies look like amateurs. I have seen people lighting up fires on tiny balconies in Zürich to BBQ on.\n\n* How much there is outside of the Alps. Maybe it was my ignorance before, but I was surprised by how many beautiful spots there are even in the topographically boring parts of the country.\n\n\n---\n\n**---My Swiss Achievements---**\n\n* Aromat on the table.\n\n* Making a fire in the countryside to roast a cervelat.\n\n* Phoned the police to lodge a nose complaint (the Bünzli award). It was 2am on a weekday and the 5th night in a row. I haven’t started to phone the police because my neighbour sneezed too loudly on a Sunday (yet....).\n\n*  Raclette grill and Fondue caquelon in the kitchen.\n\n* Waking up at 3am for the Morgestraich in Basel and tolerating other parts of Fasnacht like bands outside my window at 2am on a Tuesday morning.\n\n* Swimming and floating in lakes and rivers during the summer.\n\n* Visiting more places in Switzerland than most Swiss people I know. A new country is always more interesting than your own backyard in fairness.\n\n---\n\n**---Why I am still here---**\n\nI certainly never thought I would be here 5 years later, but I am very happy to still be around. \n\n* It is a beautiful and safe county with nice people, high quality services and infrastructure. Having put in the effort to understand the culture and learnt the language is an incentive too.\n\n* I keep finding work. The Swiss level income is a nice bonus, but it really isn’t the thing that is driving me to stay here. I am not very career driven, so long as I have enough money to enjoy myself and find the work interesting enough I am happy. \n\n* The thing I would find hardest to give up is the freedom of the landscape. The extent of the paths and smaller roads around the country that are open to anyone is amazing. Making it so easy and carefree to get out and anywhere, especially by foot or bike.\n\n* It is much more varied than you would expect. Both in landscape and culture there is plenty of different things to see and take in so there is always something interesting to do. \n\n* I also dislike driving, so the extensive public transport system is fantastic.\n\n* The self-service machines in Supermarkets are actually used in addition to normal checkouts rather than a replacement. And they actually trust you and don’t weigh your goods and shout at you if anything is 1g out of place. It might sound like a strange point to be so happy about, but compared to the UK shopping experience these days it is so nice.\n\n---\n\n\n**---What I dislike---**\n\nNot much.\n\n* Less smokers and more Australian like rules on smoking would be very nice (eg: no smoking in areas where people are eating, including outdoors). It would be nice to sit down on a terrace at a restaurant and not worry if a chain smoker is going to sit down at the table next to you.\n\n* I still have problems quickly picking the right coin out of a pile of change. Why half of them have to be so similar is beyond me, especially when the notes are so vivid and clear.\n\n* More exotic food and longer shop opening times would be nice (seeing the supermarkets closed at 18:30 was a hell of a shock at first) but I have gotten used to that. I don’t demand 24 hour shopping, but until 20:00 would be fantastic.\n\n* Jobs are mostly advertised without a salary, which you then discuss in the interview. For me at least this is rather awkward.\n\n---\n \n**---Regrets---**\n\n* Not getting a language certificate earlier.\n\n* Not joining a social club. I have looked but nothing has taken my fancy. \n\n---\n\n**---Changes with time---**\n\n* I have gotten too used to the landscape. I still admire the view from the train window, but it is never as special or exciting as during the first few months.\n\n* My town has seen a dramatic increase in English speakers. Mostly due to the growth/arrival of a few big MedTech firms. \n\n* E-bikes are increasingly everywhere. I had never seen one before I arrived and was surprised to see them all over town back in 2015. Now they are all over the countryside too with mountain E-bikes being very common in places that were previously only the domain of the most hardcore riders.\n\n* The climate seems to be getting warmer and drier every year. The amount of snow in the flat land isn’t that different to the UK these days.\n\n* The amount of rubbish and anti-social noise (especially blue-tooth speakers) seems to be getting worse. People seem especially unable to bother carrying their empty cans and disposable BBQ with them from the riverside during summer. The increasing number of people (not even just teenagers) who need an absurdly loud speaker at all times is sad, thankfully it isn’t common in the countryside (yet).",

I exposed the scammer saying that I know he's trying to scam me and that's the stupidest scam I've ever seen (for multiple reasons explained in my previous post) and that I will absolutely for no reason ship anything to the UK before receiving the money to my account.\n\nThis morning I received an email from the \"fake bank\" claiming that \"Fraud protection\" has been activated and that they will contact Interpol, the FBI and block my bank account. This is just hilarious. If you want to read the full email, [here](https://imgur.com/a/7zXnQN2)\n\nJust wanted to share with you. These people will say **anything** to scam you.

Turned out that of course it is a scam, the car is not in Switzerland and they want me to pay 50% in advance.\n\nNow I am still playing into it as it is kind of amusing, trying to get as much of data as possible from them. Waiting for the payment method to see how easy it is to trace it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to report this case to the police, I already gathered some information on them, fake email domains, fake website... which can be possible traced by authority.\n\nSince I am not for a long time in Switzerland, if someone has any experience where is the best to report this sort of scams, Cyber police, regular police, email, phone call?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit.\n\nI got their bank details in the end. I have sent the email to the bank, hope they will not ignore it.National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) did respond to my email yesterday, but as they said they are technical body and not prosecutor, so they cannot do much aside from notifying Autscout, websites they impersonate etc...Nevertheless I send them rest of the information I have if they decide to do something.",

      "title": "Time banks in Switzerland: fact or fiction?",
      "selftext": "On Indian social media, people have been sharing a post about how Switzerland has \"Time Banks\". A government pension programme where you spend time caring for elderly, and when you are old then others will spend time caring for you. In essence, you are storing your \"time\" in a \"bank\". However, when I try to Google, I really cannot find a single source that talks about this concept in Switzerland. So, is it a real thing, or just bs?\n\nHere's the original post, if you are curious:\n\n>While studying in Switzerland, I rented a house near the school. The landlord Kristina was a 67-year-old single old lady who worked as a teacher in a secondary school before she retired.  \n>  \n>Switzerland's pension is very rich, enough not to make her worry about eating and drinking in her later years. However, it is puzzling that she actually found a \"work\" - to take care of an 87-year-old single old man. I asked if she was working for money. Her answer surprised me: “I did not work for money, but I put my time in the ‘time bank’, and when I couldn’t move at old age, I could withdraw it.”  \n>  \n>The first time I heard about the concept of \"time bank\", I was very curious and asked the landlord thoroughly.  \n>  \n>The original “Time Bank” was an old-age pension program developed by the Swiss Federal Ministry of Social Security. People saved the time of taking care of the elderly when they were young, and waited until they were old, ill or needed care. Applicants must be healthy, good at communicating and full of love. Every day they have plenty of time to look after the elderly who need help. Their service hours will be deposited into the personal accounts of the social security system. She went to work twice a week, spending two hours each time, to help the elderly shopping, finishing the room, taking the elderly out to sunbathe, chatting with the elderly. According to the agreement, after one year of her service expiry, “Time Bank” will count out her working hours and issue her a “time bank card”. When she needs someone to take care of her, she can use her “time bank card” to “time bank” to withdraw “time and time interest”. After the information verification is passed, “Time Bank” will assign volunteers to take care of her to the hospital or her home.  \n>  \n>One day, I was in school and the landlady called and said she fell off the stool when she wiped the window. I quickly took leave and sent her to the hospital for treatment. The landlady broke her ankle and needed to stay in bed for a while. While I was preparing to apply for a holiday home to take care of her, the landlady told me that I did not have to worry about her. She had already submitted a withdrawal request to the “Time Bank”. Sure enough, less than two hours, \"Time Bank\" sent a nursing worker to come to care for the landlord. In the following month, the care worker took care of the landlord every day, chatted with her and made delicious meals for her. Under the meticulous care of the care giver, the landlady soon recovered to health. After recovering, the landlady went back to \"work\". She said that she intends to save time in the \"time bank\" when she is still healthy, and wait until she can't move.  \n>  \n>Today, in Switzerland, the use of \"time banks\" to support old age has become a common practice. This not only saves the country pension expenses, but also solves some other social problems. Many Swiss citizens are very supportive of this kind of old-age pensions.  \n>  \n>The survey conducted by the Swiss pension organization shows that more than half of Swiss young people also want to participate in this type of old-age care service. The Swiss government also specializes in legislation to support the \"Time Bank\" pension.",

      "selftext": "I'm not Swiss and have never visited Switzerland but ever since I discovered how Switzerland works I've been obsessed about the Swiss political system. I can honestly say it changed my life and the way I look at the world. Like many, I was becoming politicized and polarized. The Swiss democracy and the incredible smart way it works has given me hope for the future.\n\nI believe the Swiss political system is the ultimate key to a better world. You have so many great things in your system but the key aspects for me are:\n\n1. The federalized government. 3 independent governments. (federal, cantonal, local).\n2. the referendums and initiatives (on the 3 levels) and every 3 months\n3. the open lists and citizen-politicians\n4. the mixed federal government and the bottom-up (subsidiarity principle)\n\n**I've come to conclusion that the Swiss democracy is the only peaceful solution to the drastic political polarization that has been happening all over the world in the last years**\n\nLook at what is happening in the US, for example. How on earth will that divide ever be solved? They hate each other. The country is divided in half, republicans and democrats. And the sad thing is they hate each other because the system makes them hate each other. They don't see themselves as people because their system is not developed for consensus like the Swiss system.\n\nAnd this is just ideological polarization, I think it's absolutely key for all other kinds of polarization, ethnic, religious, etc. For example, there was a very interesting take on [Why Switzerland never collapsed into ethnic conflict](https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/hyvto5/why_have_we_never_collapsed_into_ethnic_conflict/) that surprisingly didn't get more people reaching the same conclusion but... In my opinion, the Swiss political system is the reason why you didn't got ethnic conflict like in Bosnia.\n\n* The pandemics might have started a chain of events that will lead to the Swiss democracy. We had the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movements because of the 2008 crisis. They targeted the financial and banking system. What will they target next? The next global movement will target the actual \"Democratic\" system, in my opinion.\n\nBut I think there's a lot of work to do because nobody knows what the Swiss democracy is. Nobody except the Swiss that is. :)\n\nAnways, what do you think? Do you think there's a chance? Would you like to see it? Does it make a difference for you?\n\nFinally, I've created a subreddit at [reddit.com/r/TheSwissDemocracy](https://reddit.com/r/TheSwissDemocracy) to specifically ask questions and geek out about the Swiss political system without annoying people in other subs. A place specifically to talk about it and to network & brainstorm. If you like to talk about your political system, please check it out as we're badly needing experts! I have a thousand questions that I want to ask so there will always be things to discuss. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone ! \n\nI have been thinking for the past year about opening a pillar 3a but it seems a bit more complicated than I thought at first. I have already searched this sub for pillar 3a questions, but most only focus on either a pillar 3a account in a bank. Only one topic seemed to  talk about the pillar 3a in insurance.\n\n\n\nHere are a few questions for those more knowledgable than me (and those of you already with a pillar 3a account!)\n\n1) It seems that many people think that having an account at a bank is better than an insurance (flexibility mostly), but what I like with the insurance, is that in the end, you get a retirement pension rather than get all the money at once once you go in retirement. Is it possible to start off with a 3a account, and then, when getting the money from the account, put it into an insurance 3a to get a pension? Will you have to pay taxes during this transfer (ie pay tax on money once you get it from the bank, then pay taxes again when getting the pension)? Or only on the pension?\n\n2) How do you compare 3a pillar providers for insurances? I don't really want to go through a broker, but there is no website like comparis (as there is for banks). For those who have a pillar 3a with insurance: how did you choose? How do you comoare things?\n\n3) What is the minimum you are required to put in an insurance 3a pillar? What do you recommend to put in a bank 3a pillar? Per month for both.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!\n\n\n\nEdit: most of you (for now) seem to say that VIAC is the best way to go. But then the first question is still there: how to get a pension rather than have all the money at once when retirement comes? \n\nThere is a possibility for several accounts and thus only get some part of the money, but those would still be good amounts of money at once, compared to a monthly pension.",

I (33F), asian, recently moved away from my Singapore to Switzerland with my husband, and I can barely understand german and my french has a whole lot of room for improvement. \n\nYesterday, while my husband was at work, I decided to walk to a brocki, 13min from my apartment. \n\nWhile I was browsing at the men’s coats/jackets section and trying on a green jacket, a stout middle age man rushes up to me (jingling keys in his hand) and spoke to me in german saying something like I was trying on a men’s jacket. And proceeds to adjust and smooth out the jacket on me, and told me that it looks good. \n\nMy first thought was that he was a staffer, as he was not holding any basket like the rest of us shoppers. So i said replied, in my broken french, “Thank you” and I thought he would like go away. But he did not.\n\nHe continued to ask if I was from thailand/vietnam/philippines, and i said no, i’m from singapore. Then, he grabbed my hand and started telling me that we are now friends and that he owns a cafe and that he has a car. It should be plainly clear that I am in no way able to converse with him properly but that did not stop him. He proceeds to ask if I live in this town, which I did not answer, and then he said he was going to drive me home. \n\nHe was still holding my hand. Then he pulls me along with him and suggests that we go the the basement of the shop, that I know from past experience of shopping there, has almost no human traffic. So I declined and shook his hands off, and started towards the cashier as I knew that the staffers were there and I thought that would be enough for him to get the message and leave me alone.\n\nBut he followed me, and walked up from behind me and touched my back and “guided” me as i walked to the counter.\n\nThere was a line, so he stood in the line with till it was my turn, and then proceeds to park himself at the exit. \n\nI was mortified. I paid for my items and i looked at the staffer assisting me and shot her a look, she immediately asked me what was the matter and i told her that I don’t know this man and he is following me around, touching me and asking me to get in his car. \n\nShe went to get her male colleague and at this point, that man started to slowly walk out the shop and away. The male staff came and walked me out to show him the man, he was only 20m away and when saw me pointing at him, he turned and crossed the road.\n\nThe staffers were very nice and helpful. Got me to stay in the shop and offered to call the police and to walk me out to my mode of transport.\n\nI stayed for 20min and then i walked home, thankfully without any incident. \n\nIt just creeps me out to think that if I didn’t know better, and left the place with him still harassing me, I probably won’t be typing this now. And that he targeted me because I am obviously a foreigner and he might also have mistook me as being much younger than I actually am.\n\nBut what truly haunts me is the way he persisted, it makes me think that he has done this before and might do this again. I hope he never succeeds(ed). I wish him nothing but the absolute worst.",

This really sucks, but I have just failed for the second time a mandatory exam in my Major program, which excludes me from continuing to study that subject.  \nNow, understandably, I am quite lost and am looking for some advice or suggestions, maybe from someone who went through a similar thing. The semester has just begun, and the exam (very conveniently) was on the first week, so that now I have enrolled in the autumn semester and at the end of it I will be banned from my faculty for failing the exam twice.  \nNow, I have come to the (late) realization that I have been studying just out of interest (I actually enjoy what I study, but don't have any direction or goal in this field) and not actually knowing what to do after the Matura, and I realize that switching to another Bachelor would probably just be another waste of time and money. Also, I am not from Zürich and, for various personal reasons, would like to go back to my hometown, since I have all my life - friends, family, hobbies, etc. - there and feel that I have lost nothing in the city.\n\nI want to act now and not regret wasting more time at University without having a clear direction. I would like either to do an commercial apprenticeship or a Praktikum back home, which you normally do before and respectively after the Matura, so that then I actually have something in my hands and have the basis for working. I know that for people who have done the Matura an apprenticeship can be shortened, and then I would have my EFZ in 2/2.5 years. But with a Praktikum (e.g. in banking), what certificate do you actually get? Are you only able to continue in a banking job? Does someone have some experiences with either one and can explain it to me? Or any experience in general about failing University and can tell me how they acted afterwards?\n\nThank you for reading and for any answer, I greatly appreciate it. Have a nice day.  \n",

This is not mentioning poor customer service. Multiple phone calls and branch visits and the issues are still there or take forever to be solved.\n\nIn contrast, PostFinance has been flawless since I opened my account there many year ago. Which makes me think that a better service is possible outside UBS. So I have decided to close the UBS account and open an account in another bank. It is important for us to have minimum 2 banks in CH. So we will keep PostFinance of course. We do only retail as we invest through other vehicles. We are both expats on permits C.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Any swiss banks you would recommend?\n\n\\- Is it possible to open an account in a regional bank in a canton we dont live in? e.g., opening in Geneva while living in Zurich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",

Examples are business related things that don’t belong in personal whatsapp conversations or comments about stupid shit our clients or other managers do. Also he‘s rather old school (aka unprofessional) if it comes to data security. He uses Android on his phone and I am not so sure he does the necessary security patches constantly. If someone would gain access to our whataspp communication we had over the years one could do quite some conclusions about many aspects of our company and cause a lot of damage.\n\nSo at some point I activated the feature in whatsapp to have messages deleted after 90 days (actually I have it on default for all my conversations with anyone and he‘s the only one who ever complained). This week my boss finally realised I had this feature activated and he got super defensive about it. He said it‘s intrusive and he asked me to deactivate it. He is oblivious to the fact that he could just deactivate it on his side but as I said he‘s a bit old school. \n\nI believe under Swiss data protection laws people have the right towards companies who store their data to have their data deleted. Does anybody know how it is in regards to personal whatsapp chats? Can I request him to keep the feature in? Can I request him to delete the complete chat history (that would also delete the messages from before I activated the 90 days disappear feature)? And would it be different if he weren‘t my boss? Could I ask my friends to delete whatsapp conversations with me?\n\nI am a bit sensitive to this topic as in a previous company (bank) I once had an assistant who didn‘t get her promotion and then went to HR to rat me out as I had discussed client related topics with her on the private whatsapp which we weren‘t allowed by company policy. \n\nExtra: do you think it‘s weird if someone has this feature activated in whatsapp to have all conversations disappear after 90 days?",

      "title": "Which swiss party is the most liberal?",
      "selftext": " \n\nGreetings! \n\nI am originally from Germany. Emigrated a little bit more than year ago to Switzerland. \n\nA friend of mine asked, whom I would vote for and I couldn't really answer him, because I have been studying most of the time that I have already spent here, and never really had the chance to read through the party programms of all big political parties. \n\nI know there are coservatives such as SVP and FDP and the Mitte. And progressives such as the Grüne/GLP . FDP labels itself as liberal with conservative accents. Mitte seems to claim to be totally in the middle between the extremes of conservativsm and progessivism (so technically liberal), judging by their name. \n\nFor further context, I don't think that the political concept of conservative (right) and progressive (left) alligns 100% with reality, because neither of those extremes leave space for real, individual freedom. That's why I say, that what lies in between these two extremes is truly liberal, because it hasn't the arrogance to progess not too much like the progressives and it also hasn't the fear that prevents further needed progess from happening like with the conservatives, but just progesses at a needed and reasonable pace. Not too little, not too much, but exactly the needed and necessary amount of progress to enable a future, more humane society. \n\n \n\nThis may sound vague and too theoretical to some, so I'll provide a few practical points, that I'd like seeing implented into the swiss society. \n\n1) A goldstandard. \n\nSwiss francs should be backed by real, material assets, so that central banks cannot print money endlessly and exploit the work force of mortal citizens by reducing the overall buying power of the citizens and also increasing their debts, because the more money get's printed, the higher the prices for day to day products such as food, housing, transport, medical healthcare and schools become. The swiss franc tied to real physical gold, prevents such a modern slavery society from emerging. No more inflations and economical crises would occure, at least no artificial ones. An abruptly stopping supply chain due to war or natural catastrophies could lead to increased prices for food and so on, due to there being more demand than supply, but that is a form of natural inflation, which vanishes when the war/catastrophe is over and the overall supply chain is restored. This would immensely strengthen the swiss economy and every citizen would greatly benefit from that. \n\n2) Concerning the immigration politics I'd say that I'd like to see Switzerland implementing the following system of living aproval for immigrants: \n\nOnly high qualified or low qualified immigrants that are necessary to ensure that the swiss economy and society can continue to function as it does or even better, should be allowed to enter the country. Refugees should be send to Italy, France, Germany and Austria. Why? Because Switzerland has only 7% land to build on and it cannot have more than 10 million inhabitants. As a matter of fact, if a war would emerge in Europe, only half of the swiss population could be fed by regional food supply due to a lot of food being imported from foreign countries into Switzerland. \n\n \n\n3) The current system of direct democracy (referendums are way easier to realise than in Germany and take place quite regurlarly, so that the people actually have a say in domestic politics and don't just vote for a party hoping that the party will fulfill the promises it gave to the voters during its election campagne) and federalism (every community and canton can micro manage itself and is only bound to certain general legal agreements , such as human rights) should absolutely be kept. \n\n4) Concerning enviorenmental policies I'd like to see Switzerland implementing the following: \n\nPublic transport should be massively expanded and generally replace cars and roads with trains and rails. Switzerland is small enough to be able to switch to a completely public transport system. \n\nThere would be no more traffic jams. No high gasoline prices and no cars worsening the air quality in cities and making life difficult for pedestrians. \n\nThe SBB should be financed entirely by taxpayers' money and no citizen should have to pay indivdually for a ticket anymore. \n\nAlso the general mindset towards environmental policies shouldn't be the idea to restrict the citizens in their quality of live in order to prevent an environmental catastrophy, but to prevent such catastrophies from happening by being inovative and inventing new techologies that are more in tune with the enviorement. \n\nNeither conservatives nor progessives seem to understand this. \n\n \n\n5) Taxes should be 5% in every canton and not one Rappen more. \n\nThis can be achived by decreasing the salary of politicians so that it is in the same range as that of secretaries (but also differing between more important positions and less important ones. So those politicians that contribute more to society earn more than those politicians who contribute less to society. So every politician should get a minimum pay, but also should be able to earn bonuses, aproved by the people/voters, if he succeeds in realizing lets say 80-90% of what he has promised during the election campaign). \n\nMany may think that 5% is too low to cover all costs that must necessarily be paid (in order to ensure ransport, energy, food, schools, hospitals and so on) but the overall mentality behind taxes should be seen as follows: \n\nIf a few individuals come together and agree upon the legality of human rights, direct democracy and federalism, and all of these individuals regurlarly use a bridge or anything material that decays over time and needs to be restored at some point, shouldn't they all equally pay those who restore that bridge or communal/public property, because they all use that object all equally, and if some of them use it more and others less, then shouldn't those who use it more pay more? And shouldn't those who don't use it that much help those out who use it much but aren't currently able to cover the costs by lending them money? (For example canton Bern has such costs to cover and Canton Zurich sends them tax money that isn't needed because all of their own necessary needs are met). \n\n \n\nThat is why I am pleading for a system, where taxes are only then raised, when they are actually needed. \n\n6) All parties should be transparent. \n\nLicense fee-funded media should be requiered to reveal all financial and other interest groups associated with the party in question, so that lobbying is not done in secret, but voters can see it and respond accordingly with a referendum, demonstrations and civil disobedience. \n\n7) Concerning the military and the right to bear arms \n\nSwitzerland should definitely keep its current military army and supply them with modern weapon systems. But this is only for the defense of our own population and national borders, not for foreign military operations. \n\nBeyond that, all soldiers should be requiered to sign a contract where they agree to abide the legal agreements (human rights, direct democracy, federalism). \n\nThis shouldn't be necessary, but I fear that the Gymnasium doesn't really teach the students about convervatives, liberals and progressives. \n\nSo the soldiers could be national socialist/communists aka conservatives and progressives. Those kind of individuals would welcome a dictatorship like in China or Russia. And they enforce the terror on the citizens, without people being able to resist. \n\nFor this scenario the US grounding fathers invented the second amendment, so that citizens of a democractic, liberal and humane state could overthrow a tyrannical regime, if one were to emerge. \n\nEvery swiss citizen who is 21 years old, and has completed the compulsary military service should own weapons. Not only Pistols and Aks with ammunition, but also explosives and Anti-drone systems and so on. The best, most modern militard equipment available in case of a tyrannical regime emerging or a foreign country declaring war to Switzerland. \n\nIf the kids in kindergarden and school are being taught about human rights, democracy, freedom and federalism, and the society that educates them is mentally and psycvologically sane, only a very a small amount will engage in criminal behaviour (such as using your weapons to murder innocent people). But such mentally ill people can be identifiied by anyone really who is sane enough to recognize someone as ill, who doesn't act all human. Of course if those recognizing themselves are morally rotten they could the accuse the sane of being insane and try to take rights to bear arms away from them, but that's how democracy works, if the people are mentally sick and enslaved to inhumane ideology, the society will reflect that. \n\nSo I place my hope in the sense of responsibility of democratic citizens because I believe in their indepence and common sense. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\nThese were the things, that I could come up with out of my head. \n\nAny idea which swiss party would suit me best?

I'm curious if my savings could potentially put me at a disadvantage compared to locals.\n\nEDIT: I was advised that a bank statement is never required when looking for an apartment.

More importantly, the media frenzy that lived for two weeks by digesting this topic over&over finally moved on and is now focused on the American Debt Ceiling. The way the media and the internet now influences financial markets is worrisome, but I won’t dwell on that now. \n\nWhat I wanted to say is that, after careful analysis over the past few weeks, I believe that our government was right to wipe out the AT1 bond holders. I have many arguments for why this is the case, but today I want to present you with a counterexample, where a government did not wipe out the bond holders.\n\nI was reading Michael Lewis’s 2011 book “Boomerang” and there is this section where he describes the actions of the Irish Finance Minister to guarantee the bond holders of the three Irish banks that failed in 2008. Please see the text attached. \n\nThis decisions proved catastrophic in the end as the government was placed on a high speed rail towards default and ended up in the hands of the IMF who completely reorganised the country’s finances and by extension its political system. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland_and_the_International_Monetary_Fund?wprov=sfti1) \n\nMy 20 cents: I love Switzerland and I think it is a great country because of its independence, autonomy and freedom. I just want to draw attention to the fact that those three virtues are not God given, but they must always be cherished, appreciated and protected. We must not grow complacent. We live in interesting times where the vast majority of people would like you — and they would even force you — to think like them (this might be because they are insecure of their own positions). But don’t be afraid to stand-up and defend unpopular opinions or the little guy, and ultimately to protect this country’s independence. It’s among the last countries on the European continent that can still genuinely claim that it’s laws are made on its own territory by its own people and not in some foreign bureaucratic building by a faceless bureaucrat looking at a dashboard.",

      "title": "Tips for International Students in Switzerland",
      "selftext": "This list is by no means exhaustive — if you have any tips of your own, please leave them in the comments and I’ll regularly update this post. Please also point out any errors I’ve made.\n\nHey everyone! I spent 4 months in Winterthur in high school in 2020 and another semester at Uni Basel in 2022-2023. From *Anmeldung,* over different insurances, and ways to save money, to looking for a place to stay, here are some things I wish I’d known before leaving. A lot of these tips will be centered around the German speaking part of Switzerland, but I’m sure many are applicable in other parts as well.\n\nIf this post shows enough engagement, I’ll write a similar one on my method of learning Swiss German. Using it, I managed to get fluent in just under 9 months total spent in Switzerland.\n\n## Living\n\n1. **Registration** ***(Anmeldung)***  \nAfter moving to Switzerland, you have 2 weeks to register at your municipality *(Gemeinde)*. Make sure not to lose your registration confirmation *(Anmeldungsbestätigung)*, as you will need it for various things before you get your residence permit. After registering (depending on chip availability, this can take months), you will receive notice to go get fingerprinted and get your photo taken for your residence permit. Once you do that, you will receive it in the mail.\n2. **Deregistration** ***(Abmeldung)***  \nBefore moving from Switzerland, you must deregister at your municipality *(Gemeinde)*.\n3. **Shared living** ***(WG)***  \nIf you are looking for a room in a shared apartment, try websites like [wgzimmer.ch](http://wgzimmer.ch/), [meinwgzimmer.ch](http://meinwgzimmer.ch/), or [weegee.ch](http://weegee.ch/). Also try looking for organizations like [WoVe](https://wove.ch/) in Basel: a non-profit offering student accommodation. From my experience, WoVe are professional and it is very easy to get a room if you act soon enough (without having to go there in person beforehand).\n4. **University Dorms**  \nYour university might offer dorms for a good price, make sure to do some research on those and act quickly if you want to get a room there.\n\n## Money\n\n1. **Revolut / Wise**  \nIf you don’t need a Swiss bank account, Revolut or Wise are both great options. They offer free accounts and the best exchange rates on the market. I personally use Revolut and am very happy with it — not just for my stay in Switzerland, but for traveling in general.\n2. **Cantonal Bank** ***(Kantonalbank)***  \nIf you do need a Swiss bank account, try your local cantonal bank *(Kantonalbank)*. They often offer free accounts for students.\n\n## Insurance\n\n1. **Don’t get Swiss health insurance** ***(Krankenversicherung)*** **if you don’t have to.**  \nInsurance is mandatory in Switzerland, but it is notoriously expensive, and chances are (if you’re in Switzerland temporarily) you can keep your insurance in your home country and have it recognized in Switzerland. If you’re from the European Union, just having the blue EHIC card is enough! You can apply for an exemption from the compulsory health insurance *(Befreiung von der Versicherungspflicht)* [online](https://versicherungspflicht.kvg.org/de/).\n2. **If you have to get Swiss health insurance, get the right one.**  \nNot any insurance is valid as the compulsory basic health insurance. This usually costs over CHF 200 per month, so make sure you’re not getting something like an “insurance for foreign students” for CHF 120 per month which actually most likely doesn’t cover this. You should be looking for a basic insurance *(Grundversicherung)*. [Priminfo](https://www.priminfo.admin.ch/de/praemien) is a neutral premium calculator provided by the government to find the right plan for you.\n3. **If you’re getting Swiss health insurance, you don’t have to get it before you arrive.**  \nYou have three months after your arrival to Switzerland to get insured (or apply for an exemption as mentioned above). However, you do have to pay for it from day one, so if you get insured 2 months after your arrival, you have to pay for these 2 months retroactively.\n4. **Don’t get Swiss supplementary insurance (Zusatzversicherung) if you don’t have to.**  \nThe basic insurance (or the one recognized from your home country) only covers the most basic, necessary stuff (and doesn’t cover 100% of transport costs, for example by ambulance). Therefore, it is often a good idea to also get a supplementary insurance *(Zusatzversicherung)* to cover extras. Again, though, these are often expensive in Switzerland and your home country might offer a much better deal on travel insurance for your stay in Switzerland.\n5. **What is a** ***Franchise/Selbstbehalt*****?**  \n(Only relevant if you’re getting insurance in Switzerland) *Franchise*, always between CHF 300 and CHF 2500, is the amount up to which you cover 100% of healthcare costs. A low *Franchise* will raise your monthly health insurance costs, a high *Franchise* will lower them. It is up to you to decide whether to take the risk of paying a low monthly cost, but having to pay more in case of a more serious injury. *Selbstbehalt* is what you pay for healthcare (10% of the total cost) once over your *Franchise*. Example: You choose a *Franchise* of CHF 500. Throughout the year, the total cost for your healthcare is CHF 2000. You pay CHF 500 because of your *Franchise* and 10% of the rest *(Selbstbehalt — CHF 150)*, for a total of CHF 650 on top of your monthly health insurance payments.\n6. **Household Insurance** ***(Haushaltsversicherung)***  \nSome places (such as WoVe in Basel as mentioned above) will require you to get household insurance *(Haushaltsversicherung)*. From my experience, [AXA](https://www.axa.ch/) offers reasonable pricing and everything can be done online.\n\n## Food\n\n1. **Don’t eat out.**  \nRule number one for saving money in Switzerland is don’t go to restaurants and forget fast-food. Cook for yourself, or share cooking with your roommates for maximum savings. Spending CHF 20-25 for a meal at Burger King is not unusual.\n2. **Limit Meat Consumption**  \nIf you come from a region where meat is cheap (Central, Eastern Europe), you might want to reconsider your meat consumption. Chicken is by far the cheapest meat in Switzerland, but still not something I’d go for every day. I’m sure you’ll learn to appreciate rice, pasta, lentils, and vegetables.\n3. **University Cafeteria**  \nIf you don’t want to make lunch boxes for yourself, your best bet for a warm meal is your university’s cafeteria. They often offer full meals for around CHF 10, an otherwise unbeatable price.\n4. **Migros vs. Coop**  \nMuch like the “does pineapple belong on pizza” question, Migros vs. Coop is a divisive topic. Many Swiss people call themselves either a *Migros-Kind* or *Coop-Kind* (Migros Kid / Coop Kid) and stick to their chain. Realistically, the differences are not stark. Migros is generally ever so slightly cheaper, but doesn’t sell alcohol and tobacco products. Coop sells alcohol and tobacco products to people over 18 years of age.\n5. **Denner & Lidl**  \nDenner and Lidl are discount stores. They offer lower prices, but sometimes the range of products sold is smaller. The food is not low quality and these chains are a great place to shop if you’re looking to save some money.\n6. **Shopping in Neighboring Countries**  \nIf you’re staying close to the border (such as Basel), getting groceries in neighboring countries is a great way to save significant amounts of money. If you live in Basel, take the 8 tram to *Weil am Rhein, Dreiländerbrücke* and get your groceries in *Marktkauf*, make sure to get an export certificate *(Ausfuhrschein)*. On your way back, make sure to stop at the border, go to the customs booth *(Zoll)* and present your receipt with the *Ausfuhrschein* and your Swiss residence permit (without it, it will not work). This way, you will get your sales tax back! The customs officer will stamp your Ausfuhrschein and the next time you go back to the store where you got it, you will get your sales tax back.\n7. **Äss-Bar**  \n[This amusingly named chain](https://www.aess-bar.ch/) sells yesterday’s baked goods for a lower price. Check if your town has one — the pastries and cakes are often just as good as fresh ones.\n8. **toogoodtogo**  \ntoogoodtogo is a great option to save money: you can get food that’s about to go bad for a fraction of its original price. Download the app and try it out! I had the best luck with offers from Migrolino.\n9. **Last Resort: Public Fridges**  \nThere are many so-called public fridges around Switzerland, for example those operated by [Madame Frigo](https://www.madamefrigo.ch/). Anyone can come by and take food out of the fridge for free — usually on a first come, first serve basis. However, please be considerate: if you can afford to buy your own food, please leave these to those who cannot.\n\n## Transport\n\n1. **Half-Fare Travelcard** ***(Halbtax-Abo)*** **and Other Subscriptions**  \nSBB (Swiss Railways) offers many different plans and subscriptions. For example, you will probably want to get the Half-Fade Travelcard *(Halbtax-Abo)* if you plan to travel at all — with it, you get 50% off most public transport around Switzerland. The [GA Travelcard](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/ga.html) *(Generalabonnement)* offers mostly unlimited travel around the country. Check out the different options [here](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets.html).\n2. **Regional Subscription**  \nYour region will probably have a monthly plan. For example: [TNW’s *U-Abo*](https://www.tnw.ch/tickets-preise/abonnemente/das-u-abo) in Northwestern Switzerland (Basel and surroundings). You might save on it over buying individual tickets.\n3. **Bikes**  \nMuch like the Netherlands, the vast majority of Switzerland is perfectly suitable for riding a bike. If you can’t bring your own, consider getting a cheap bike at the beginning of your stay; try asking previous tenants who are moving out if they have one they would like to sell or gift.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n1. **Swiss Bureaucracy: Resolving Catch-22 Situations**  \nIt is not unlikely you will encounter what appears to be a Catch-22 situation during your stay. Navigating Swiss bureaucracy can be challenging, but with proper communication, it's usually possible to find a way out of difficult situations. Don’t be afraid to send e-mails or make calls asking questions — you will most likely get a helpful answer.\n2. **You don’t need to learn Swiss German** ***(Schweizerdeutsch / Schwiizerdütsch)*****.**  \nBut it’s probably a good idea. You can get around with just standard German, if not English, but if you can, try to learn to understand the dialect, even if you answer in High German. All Swiss people understand and speak High German, but prefer to speak the dialect. If you struggle with it, don’t be afraid to ask people to speak standard German *(Hochdeutsch)* with you.\n3. **Sidewalk Libraries** ***(Öffentliche Bücherschränke)***  \nSwitzerland is full of sidewalk libraries. If you need something to read, try your luck and one of those before spending money on books. Wikipedia offers a [non-exhaustive list of sidewalk libraries in Switzerland](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_%C3%B6ffentlicher_B%C3%BCcherschr%C3%A4nke_in_der_Schweiz) (in German).\n4. **Ordering stuff online is often cheaper than buying it in person.**  \nBooks being a great example, some things are much more expensive in Switzerland than elsewhere. Therefore, it is often a good idea to check online (for example [German Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/)) for better prices.\n5. **Stuff on Sidewalks**  \nIn Switzerland, you will often find books, kitchenware and more in front of people’s houses with signs saying *Gratis, zum Mitnehmen* or something similar — help yourself, their owners will throw them away otherwise.\n6. **Flea Market** ***(Flohmarkt, Flohmi)***  \nFlea markets are very common in Switzerland, many towns have them weekly. They are a great way to get second-hand stuff such as kitchenware for low prices. Websites such as [Flohmarkt24](https://www.flohmarkt24.ch/) or [Flohmarktkalender](https://www.flohmarktkalender.ch/) show listings for flea markets around the country.\n7. **Tutti / Ricardo: The Swiss Craigslist**  \n[Tutti](https://tutti.ch/) and [Ricardo](https://www.ricardo.ch/) are great websites to find cheap (or free) stuff. Ricardo takes a cut of the sale and requires an account with a Swiss phone number, Tutti has neither of these requirements. Spend 5-10 minutes on your daily commute browsing through CHF 0 listings on Tutti and you might find a gem!\n8. **Recycling**  \nRecycling is very important in Switzerland. With your *Anmeldung*, you will most likely get a “waste calendar” *(Abfallkalender)*, detailing when different kinds of waste are collected. For general waste, you need special trash bags *(Gebührensäcke)*, otherwise your trash will not be collected. They cost more than regular trash bags; that’s how waste collection is financed in Switzerland. Recycling is mostly free, so the more you recycle, the less you pay. For more detailed information, consult [abfall.ch](https://www.abfall.ch/).\n9. **Cellular Plans**  \nCellular plans are expensive in Switzerland. Make sure to consider all options before making a purchase: compare plans from providers in your country, plans from standard providers such as [Sunrise](https://sunrise.ch/), and plans from online providers such as [Yallo](https://yallo.ch/). Make sure you understand your contract and you’re not signing a 2-year one if you’re only staying for a semester.\n10. **Erasmus Student Network (ESN)**  \nYour university will most likely have some local students organizing events for international students. Ask around, and don’t let the name scare you — they are open to everyone, not limited to Erasmus students.\n11. **Serafe: The Radio and TV Fee**  \nYou might get hit with the Serafe fee if you live in an apartment with a TV or radio — it is a per-year, per-household fee, so work it out with your roommates. Don’t try to dodge it.",

These were apparently booked on my Mastercard debit card issued by PostFinance and said „Apple.com/bill“ in the description — nothing was bought through my iTunes account though. When I had it blocked, both the hotline as well the lady at the counter at their branch in Zurich told me I wasn’t the first person with this exact problem that day. One of them said though do that even though I blocked my card as soon as I found out and also filed a complaint to try to get my money refunded they think that chances for success are low, which tbh I find very upsetting. So, had anybody else had been having this problem past weekend? And what do you think are my chances of getting those 500,- back?",

They asked me what happened and I told them I forgot to take the purse from the hood and it flew off the moment I entered the autobahn. I spoke to them in German although I am not the best in speaking German. They took the picture of my Aufenthaltsteile(which they do it in Germany too. Usually to send you a fine later or if you are a witness to a crime). Also took the picture of the car. So I asked them if I'm gonna recieve a fine, to which they said \"nein, alles gut\".

The one I visited was over my budget but I was curious. During the tour of the home, the realtor was really chatty, like borderline annoying and he seemed very unprofessional (he didn't know anything about the apartment like year of construction of the building, etc.). He said something about taking over the mortgage from the previous owner with a interest rate of something like 1% but didn't even know which bank it was at (I thought this is no longer a thing???).\nHe reminded me of a seller at a bazaar and said things like \"We like you and would waive our fee for you\", \"Well, this apartment would be ideal for you, you would be the best fitting candidate\" and he talked badly about other interested parties and gave many personal details about the seller, like that the seller's wife wants him to sell it fast, but they live seperately etc.\n\nAny other contact was only with his assistant via Whatsapp (call and chat) and they really tried to lure me in, like \"act fast\", trying to put me under pressure and that I am the last person to visit because there are many potential buyers.\n\nWhen I said I am interested but need time to think (a white lie for investigative reasons as I wanted to learn about their process and I really liked the apartment but knew I didn't have the funds) he told me the amount of the reservation and then later his assistant called me to say it's actually more than what he told me due to the sellers demands. I told my uncle (who is super savvy in this matters) and he did some research and apparently, they don't even have an entry in the Handelsregister and I didn't even find what kind of company they are (AG, GmbH, etc.). The account for the reservation money would be theirs, not at a Notar or anything (although I would have insisted on this).\n\nWhen I didn't want to further investigate, I told them (by Whatsapp) that I am no longer interested. I didn't get a single word back, not even and \"ok\", when before they were super fast when responding and building up pressure to \"act fast\".\n\nSo, I am inexperienced and am only learning how to buy property and maybe I am naive to answer an ad without researching the authors, but I did learn a lot. I am still curious, has anyone else had experience with this \"agency\"? Would you agree it was a scam?\n\nThe same apartment is now online from another company (an AG with Handelregistereintrag) and Immokaba listed it again as well (maybe not so many buyers after all?).",

      "selftext": " Hello everyone, \n\nI am thinking of applying to the MSc in Applied Information and Data Science at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.\n\nThis would imply eventually quitting my job as Relationship Manager Assistant at a Private Bank which pays very well for what I do, but isn’t very interesting overall.\n\nThere is no career progression as an assistant, and I cannot picture myself working in this role for decades. On the other hand, data science or data analytics is something I have been interested in for a long time. I am just worried about making the right decision.  \n\nDo you think someone with my background + Bachelor’s in economics + the above master’s can be interesting for future employers? How saturated is the market in Switzerland?\n\nAll the students I questioned seemed overall happy with the course, but a lot of them already had a job related to data / computer science and used this degree to get ahead in an existing role. \n\nI am also aware that there are data science graduates from ETHZ / EPFL who might be preferred by employers. \n\nInsights are very welcome!",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nApologies if this has been asked, god knows I've been looking, but keep getting different opinions online, thought I'd come to reddit to see if anyone has first hand experience. \n\nSome websites say that you need a Swiss bank account to sign the lease to rent an apartment, is this correct? Or would it be possible (with a guarantor as a back ie.  Parents) to make the down-payment, pay the initial month etc and then get a Swiss bank account to continue paying the rest? This second option is what my university co-ordinator suggested I do, but I want to check it's actually possible before I shoot myself in the foot.\n\nSome background, I am starting as a salaried PhD (candoc) at the University of geneva and was told I could get there start and then just open a bank account ASAP so they could pay my striped into it. I have the paper from the university/employer stating what my contract will be and what my pay will be, I just don't want to show up to an already competitive housing market and be told \"nah, you don't have a Swiss bank account\".\n\nBottom line, should I make an effort to open the account before trying to start renting or will it not be a problem? Before someone says just open one before, I  currently still abroad and would be having to make the trip to do so, so while possibile it is not easy or ideal at the moment.\n\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "selftext": "* I miss the old bank notes :( but to be honest I can now go weeks without using cash which is nice. Twint and contactless cards really picked up ah? I even saw an old lady pay with her apple watch at Aldi, I felt like living in Minority report. \n* I guess long and unkept grass is now promoted in all cities? I really like it, but a few years back no municipal gardeners would have let grass go wild I'm pretty sure.\n* Tibetan food is now the next big thing? I didn't know what a Momo was and now it's everywhere. Again nothing against it but it's funny how new cuisine can become famous like that.\n* Gifi, Maxi Bazar, Livique, Rituals, Aldi, Chicorée, Metro, Nature et découverte (and more I'm forgetting) every city center is now the same (at least in Suisse romande) this makes me a bit sad, it seems like a lot of small local shops got wiped out.\n* This might be anecdotical but I see  a lot more cars stranded on the emergency lane on the highway when I'm driving.\n* Trains are still on time and efficient, but the new double decker trains really feel cramped and convoluted with the stairs up and down.\n* Fnac and Manor merged or what?\n* LGBT pride is now so mainstream that they had to organise a counter anticapitalist one this year. That change really makes me happy though 😂\n* Cider is everywhere now? Sushi at Coop, Migros and Aldi? WTF is Mate?\n* I love self check outs even if I feel bad for the employees.\n* Sunday is still a dead day but I enjoy it.\n* Is it me or every train is full of school classes on day trips suddenly? Maybe this is because it was the end of the school year.\n* CFF/SBB controllers now have an Iphone as their main equipment. But they still keep the old school punch machine for the odd kid with a paper travel card who wants to have their cards punched. That's cute. \n* Second hand shops and vintage shops are everywhere and I'm here for it.\n* WTF is up with girls wearing black leather pants? It seems to have stopped with the temperatures currently but I am sure it will be back in winter and it's just not good looking. \n* Sales are now called \"no waste\" or whatever greenwashing label they picked. I won't complain with 50% meat at coop though.\n* Spare ribs in every BBQ sections\n* Most farms have a self checkout booth with a twint account associated, that's amazing. \n\n\nI'm probably missing a lot of other new things but if you haven't noticed Switzerland changed quite a lot in a few years, anything else you noticed?",

      "selftext": "With UPC it is only possible to get a contract changed or cancelled by calling them or using the chat function.\n\nSo, two years ago we moved, and since Swisscom is doing everything in their power to stay in control of the last mile they keep on having terrible copper speeds (they started with fibre work this week, but they are bulding FTTS, max 500Mbit download. Why? It's technologically impossible to cut them out and and every competitor has to use their infrastructure -> more money for Swisscom)\n\nI was happy because I could get a 1Gbit/100Mbit connection with UPC, which was an improvement from the stoneage 100/10Mbit we could get before.\n\nAfter two years my offer of 1Gbit Internet + TV replay for CHF69 ran out. Due to us using TV about twice a year, paying CHF 129 now is not really feasible. So I wanted to downgrade to Internet only for CHF99.\n\nChanging my subscription in MyUPC wasn't possible. So I had to call. The callcenter operator was shifty and somehow always started talking about TV. I repeatedly said I only wanted Internet.\n\nFinally he confirms the contract was changed. The next day I notice I now have a contract of 1Gbit Internet with TV for CHF59 on top, i.e. CHF 159 per month. Wtf.\n\nSo I call the next day again. I spent nearly one hour on the phone and they confirmes they fixed it and would send conformation.\n\nIt's three days later now. I still have that CHF 159 contract in my account.\n\nI can't write them, because they don't accept that. I can only fucking call them. And it's just shitty: callcenter operators are constantly trying to upsell you, use confusing language all the time and I'm here wondering: what recourse do I have? I have nothing in writing. If I cancel my contract and they don't cancel, how am I supposed to provide proof that I actually cancelled with them? I have nothing in writing.\n\nAlso, does anyone know if UPC and Sunrise now operate as one entity? I noticed I could get the same 1Gbit/100Mbit connection through Sunrise with another offer. So I'm thinking whether it's possible to cancel UPC, go to Sunrise and get another new customer offer for the same product from them.\n\nToo bad Switzerland is slipping into the Internet stoneage, except where public utilities built the FTTH fibre network.\n\nCheck the [fibre atlas](https://s.geo.admin.ch/652919082605) with 1Gbit upload selected (means FTTH available) and see how the right Lake Zürich bank, it's all green. The left bank has nothing. \"Socialism\" in the form of public works that do the work Swisscom doesn't want to do suddenly seems a great thing in those very fiscally liberal municipalities.",

I found a solution and thought I'd post it here for others in the same situation.\n\nOnly one bank was able to help me: UBS. And only their branch at the zürich airport. But it worked and was fairly easy (German ssn, American ssn, contract). I ended up not getting the basic package and upgraded and will pay 10 francs a month plus 50 a year. For me this is totally worth it, as without it  I wouldn't be able to open an account. \n\nAlls well that ends well! Thanks for all of your help and support.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI would like to have your opinion about something: about one month ago, I left an apartment. During the apartment revision, the employee from the agency noticed that the shower head holder was slightly loose and moved a bit (the only \"deffect\" that was found during the whole revision). He verbally said then that this was due to normal usage (\"usure normal\") and that it had to be repaired by the owner and the same was reflected, **literally**, in the handover document (état des lieux), that both the agency employee and myself signed and of which I have a copy, naturally. I want to remark that the document says, literally, *Etat* (state):  *A réparer à la charge du propriétaire* (to be repaired by the proprietary) and *Action et facturation* (Action and invoicing): *A réparer à la charge du propriétaire* (to be repaired by the owner). I also know that the agency already sent to my bank the letter to request the total refund of the rental deposit to me, which should arrive tomorrow or next week.\n\nWell, today I received a letter from the agency (in my new address) claiming that, according to the law, this repairment needs to be taken care of by the tenant. I am wondering if this is remotely normal or they just regret now to have considered the deffect as normal usage and they want to throw the stone and see if I accept to pay for this. It is over 120 CHF, and even if it could be worse, I am quite pissed off to have to pay, honestly.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: out of curiosity, I checked the entry document when I took over the apartment, also signed by the agency and myself and, to my surprise, that document already mentioned that the shiwe head holder was loose by then, so definitely I think that they are just trying to scam me and of course I will mention this in my formal claim to refuse the payment of the invoice.",

However, he apparently did not mention the invoice or reference number in that transfer. A few weeks later, he received a \"Mahnung\" from Fedex saying that the bill was unpaid. He communicated a bit via email and phone with customer support and eventually sent proof of payment (bank transfer statement PDF) to them via email. That last email was never replied to, which I understand means that it cannot legally be viewed as delivered. \n\nEventually, he received another letter by an \"Inkasso\" / debt collector, prompting him to pay the invoice + a big surcharge. Also, they state if he does not pay within 10 days, this will move to the \"Betreibungsamt\", who will then legally pursue this. As I understand, a \"Betreibung\" is quite a bad thing, so naturally he wants to avoid that. \n\nWithout going into all the details of the low-key threats and objectionable business practices Fedex and the \"Inkasso\" employ here, I am wondering what is the best way forward for him?\n\nOn the face of it, it would seem best to ignore this, as there is clear proof of timely payment of the original invoice in full, and the internet is full of people unhappy with Fedex in Switzerland, reporting similar problems. Also, I understand that as a next step, Fedex or the debt collector would have to actually prove that my friend owes the money, and I have a hard time to see how they could do that. Theoretically, one could imagine that by not mentioning the invoice number he made it difficult for Fedex to locate the payment, but surely they should be able to locate it with the bank statement's transfer details. However, I am no legal expert and also don't live in Switzerland, and my friend only moved there recently. \n\nSo, I am wondering if the community has any experiences or useful advice?\n\nThanks in advance!",

We terminated the contract immediately, no damages were found in the apartment but the former landlord does not pay out the full deposit for two years now so we went to the arbitration board again and since he did not accept their decision (they agreed with us) we now sued him and have a civil court (Zivilgericht) hearing. During all this he tried to delay and harass us.  \n\n\nOverall we are **quite confident with the evidence we have but it is also a somewhat complex** matter so we wanted to ask if **you have any experience and can give some recommendations on how to prepare for the civil court hearing** **and what strategy to pursue in the hearing.** We would especially like to understand what we can do to prevent further postponements and filibuster.\n\n# Prelude\n\nIn 2018, my gf (now wife) moved into a low-cost apartment in a central location in Basel with mainly low income foreigners or people on unemployment/ AHV. After a bit more than a year, the building administration sent the first **utilities cost statement which came as a huge shock: it was roughly 2x what they charged as monthly down payment** stated in the rental contract and there were many inconsistencies in the cost statement itself. After some research, we asked the administration to correct the statement in multiple positions and to provide further detail on the distribution key for heating etc.\n\nAs you would expect, the administration tried to deny everything and was also extremely uncooperative, i.e. they would not reply for weeks, extremely unfriendly in emails and also started to ignore our calls once they knew our number. After some time, we had enough and decided to take this case to the arbitration board for rental disputes.\n\n# First Arbitration Hearing\n\nOn the first date for arbitration, the opposition did not show up. They called 5 minutes after the initial start of the appointment and claimed they had an unexpected death so they could not come. Unlikely, but benefit of the doubt. On the second date, the opposition showed up but could not provide any documents the arbitration board (and us) asked them to provide in advance, so it was decided that we needed a third (!) hearing where they would bring these documents (i.e., distribution key etc.).\n\nOn the third hearing it was finally decided that their **utilities cost were deceptive as the cost in previous years were \\~60% higher than what they charged in the down payment**. Therefore, we **would not have to pay more than the down payment**. However, the judge also explained that with this decision, the deceit was unveiled and we would have to accept the higher total rent or move out.\n\nSo we terminated the contract immediately and moved out in March 2020. During the handover, **no damages were found, a handover protocol was signed** and the new tenant moved in the following month.\n\n# Second Arbitration Hearing\n\nAs we expected, they did not pay out our rental deposit immediately. At first they claimed that they found hidden damage (versteckte Mängel) in the apartment after we left and would need to hold back the deposit until everything was assessed. Hidden damage is basically some serious malicious actions from tenants (i.e. clog pipes with cement etc.). Needless to say that we didn't do anything the like. After they sent a handyman, no hidden damage was found so they started to claim that they need to hold it back for the utility charge of the year. We repeatedly inquired for pay-out and **after 9 months, they transferred approximately half of the deposit**. Legally, they can hold it back for up to 12 months. After 12 months and additional inquiries they literally wrote us *\"well you need to go to the arbitration then.\" -* so we did.\n\nShortly before the initial date of the arbitration hearing, the landlord hired a lawyer which postponed the hearing again. Reason: he needs time to read into the documents. After another couple of months, the hearing took place and interestingly enough, the lawyer claimed not to know any of the documents we handed in for the hearing (note that everything by default goes to the opposition party). The **arbitration board ruled that he will have to pay us out the remaining amount.**\n\nHowever, after ten days the landlord rejected the ruling of the arbitration board which gave us the permission to sue him through the civil court. Of course, this was a tactic from him hoping we would not go this far. However, we decided to sue out of principle at this point since we learned that he was known to exploit his mainly low income tenants who would not easily find housing elsewhere. Some neighbours literally cried when receiving the bills as they had no way to pay and did not fully understand what these claims were for. \n\n# Civil Court Hearing\n\nWe **set up a claim for payment of the outstanding deposit, an allowance for the unnecessary time we had to spend on this matter plus an interest of 5% until payment to avoid further deferral from his side**. We don't expect to receive any allowance but believe the interest will push urgency.\n\nThe civil court soon accepted our case and found a date. Of course, shortly before the date of the hearing the lawyer of the landlord handed in a request to postpone the hearing as he *\"was busy because of Corona and lawyers would also need some vacation*\". No joke. The court accepted this excuse and postponed the hearing again.\n\nAt this point we had to postpone the second date as our first child was born exactly during this time. The new appointment was scheduled two months later. However, the lawyer of the landlord then quit his mandate via letter to the court and the landlord was mandated to appear himself. Now the landlord claimed he cannot appear himself due to old age/ Corona and has appointed a new lawyer, the hearing is now scheduled for March.\n\n# Side Notes\n\nWhat I did not mention above is that between every iteration, we had to call them multiple times, write multiple emails and received nasty answers all the time. The landlord changed his administration  6 times since the original rental agreement was signed, making the whole procedure more complicated. However he seemed to not have paid his bills with  former administrations and they have been very helpful by providing pointers, evidence and other some helpful documents.\n\nThe landlord sent us multiple bizarre letters with weird claims and multiple insults. For example he mentioned the city of Basel was liable of damage because they contaminate the water which would damage the piping. In his writing he complains about water damages in the apartment and lists some costs, however these claims all came after we moved out and the new tenant already moved in. Along with the confirmation that there were no hidden damages we think these claims should be ungrounded. Furthermore, his lawyer sent us a letter in which he proposed to settle the case outside of court but with a ridiculous offer: they would not ask us for further charges and the matter would be settled.\n\nIt is also worth to mention that the bank of the rental deposit made a mistake with the resolution of the account. The landlord's administration instructed them to pay CHF 1'500 to the landlord \"*as agreed in the handover protocol attached\"* however they did not attach the protocol which would have stated that there was no damage and we wouldn't need to pay anything. We contacted the bank about this and they have launched an internal investigation.\n\nWe went for consultation to the tenant's association (Mieterverband) before we went to the arbitration board the first time. Apparently this landlord is known to the Basel courts since the 80s and has a reputation of this behaviour. However, we didn't find their advice too helpful so we went on our own and as you could see from the two \"won\" cases in the arbitration board it turned out quite ok.",

      "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nRecently I made a huge decision and together with my girlfriend we decided to buy an apartment close to Zurich. If everything goes well and on time we will get the key in summer 2023.\n\nHere comes the tricky part, at least for me. We can already close the mortgage (up to 1.5y in advance) but there are so many different combinations compared to my country and I'm not sure what to do due to the uncertainly of the markets. Also i found a bank that doesn't charge anything in case the apartment is delayed, so no extra in case of closing it now.\n\nMy first idea was to get a 10y mortgage (around 1.2%-1.3%) just to have a fixed rate and not to worry about increases in interest due to inflation. But then, in a second thought, a variable rate right now, Saron 3M + spread (0.85%), gives you a comfy 0.85% for a long time since Saron is around -0.7% so still have a lot of room up without any reflection on your monthly payment. Also historically has been really low, and even though inflation is going up in USA, it's unlikely that will happen soon in Switzerland. But nobody has a crystal ball so anything can happen.  Should I do tranches? funny that the 2y tranche is has a lower interest (0.75%) than the variable. \n\nAs of today I'm more towards closing a full variable mortgage. Any advice for me before getting into so much debt? \n\nThanks a lot!",

I followed the advice given by a few helpful members and recieved my first payment of 1/3rd of the amount owed today.\n\nI tried a few things-\n\n1) Compiled all of the information and called the local police. They were sympathetic but ultimately did nothing it seems. I power played the scammer and copied him on the message to the police but he continued to be unresponsive. \n\n2) Contacted an Inkasso service in Zurich. As a private individual it was difficult to have anyone take my case but finally found someone willing to take it for a 15 percent cut of recovered value. \n\nThe inkasso reached out to the scammer several times and finally received a message that the scammer had taken legal advice. A few days later a payment plan was proposed that I agreed to via the inkasso. \n\nWe were not out of the woods yet until that sweet, sweet Swiss dosh hit my bank account. Which was today! Hopefully he continues to pay over the next 2 monthes but it seems he will keep his word. \n\nThanks!",

An interesting tribespeople of Europe. And this is printed in your coins. \nIn my country, that’s absurd. National identity is all over the place really. \n\nThen there is the magnificent skepticism of yours. You say “No” to a lot of international conflicts. Somebody approaches you and demands your help from this but you say not. \n\nAnd the banking thing is quite interesting too. You’ve made excellent relations with the rest of the world. They’re all fighting each themselves like crazy and you just watch it like some big show. I live in America, I’m in the show. \n\nEspecially seeing that in a global pandemic, many countries did awful. Kudos to you for doing well. I know some of you may be complaining, but honestly it is true. \nI’m a multinational citizen so I can interpret events from different views. I read Swiss newspapers and things are interpreted usually so cynically. Like “Oh, they’re going at it again.”\n\nRegarding your health, you have some of the best systems in the world. Sure, it’s not perfect, we’re all humans after all. But oh boy, you should see how some countries handle their healthcare. They’re sloppy with it. \n\nWhen it comes to freedom of the press, you excel that in so many ways compared to other countries. \n\nYour cities are clean. Oh my god, look at Los Angeles and New York. It’s a fucking jungle in those cities. In San Francisco, there is an app that tells you where feces and garbage is on the streets so you know where to avoid walking. \n\nYour pop culture is relatively interesting. Art Basel, that classical event in Luzerne, all the events in Gstaad, etc... \n\nI also notice perhaps you don’t love spectacle as much as other countries. Some countries love it. Although, you are excellent team in FIFA. \n\nEducation is much more taken seriously In Switzerland. A public school in Switzerland is very from a public school in France for example. And that’s your neighbor. \n\nHow do you do all this? What’s the secret to running a more functioning democracy like yours?",

So I am wondering whether there’s a better option. Right now I still have a ING bank card in EUR with a mount of money. I was considering to transfer all the money into my new Swiss bank card and close it (it cost me ~5 euros/m), but is it a better idea to keep it?\n\nI also heard of Raiffeisen. Seems that with its bank card, I’ll have free access to any Swiss museum.

I'd imagine in most similar cases, those people would be informally exempted at the discretion of the authorities and left to their own device until they decide to return to an active life whereupon they'll have a bunch of debts to pay. \n\nBut what if such a person suddenly inherits a house from a long-forgotten great-aunt?\n\nSuddenly, that person will have property which will have to be noted in a declaration of fortune on which base taxes will be collected. \n\nWould/could the property be seized from him and sold at auction?\n\nI don't expect anyone here to be Civil Law experts, just a thought that I had this morning.\n\nEdit: thx for the thoughtful answers!",

      "selftext": "For starters I'd like to say that I have only been here for just over a year and living life as an international student in the french speaking part of Switzerland.\n\nI come from a country that is very much struggling in these past decades. We lack many things that the western world has readily available.\n\nEver since living here, truly I haven't experienced such simplicity and peace of mind in actually every aspect of life. Back where I'm from basically everything is a struggle, administration only advances via bribery or connections. Education is lackluster, although the country is very safe it is not well kept or clean by any means (except some rare areas) and we have little to no public transport.\n\nSwitzerland, on the contrary has all these things and way more. The first day I arrived in Switzerland I was able to get an attestation saying I am a resident. I arrived at 8 am sharp at the commune and received my paper within 5 minutes... A few hours later that same day I was able to set up 2 bank accounts, finalize paperwork for my house and all other details such as getting a phone number, internet, transport etc... All within a couple hours.\n\nAll the trains and buses arrive exactly at the designated time and leave at the designated time. With very few exceptions. And when they ARE late, it is announced beforehand. \n\nEverything works like clockwork. The cities are clean, the people are smiling and kind and happy with their lives. You have natural views and lakes and mountains and both small beautiful towns and large bustling and rich cities.  Not to mention there's internet everywhere and it's blazing fast. I stopped even thinking about my consumption as it's unlimited.\n\nPeople don't have this daily struggle with their government and their life as a whole and there aren't that many people below the poverty line. And when there are, there's systems put in place to help them. \n\nHell even the army is respected and works well and the recruitment system isn't a hell to navigate (in comparison to my home)\n\nAnd yet... people manage to complain, somehow ?\nEspecially Europeans and Swiss people. Like why is it such a big deal the bus was a couple minutes late that's not even that late ? Why are you complaining about the politics ? you have a functional democracy and not a military led country. You have peace. Your cities are clean and very safe, for fucks sake even the beggars have some sort of manners and leave you alone after a \"no\" or two.\n\nYes there are definitely problems that I do not see having lived here for a very short time. There are definitely issues I'm not saying they are non existent. But as far as having a safe, comfortable, functioning society. The swiss have accomplished this and far more. It seems people take this for granted. I don't think the majority of swiss people have known the misery and poverty of struggling countries such as mine and they cannot fathom it.\n\nAlthough I come from a struggling place I never struggled for anything in my life and live a comfortable and privileged life so much that I was able to move to Switzerland. I am aware of my privilege and am grateful for it every day. But despite this, even the simplest things are still a struggle when over here I can do everything from the comfort of my home online or by post without having to stand in line for hours in 45C heat.\n\nI wish that people would not take their luxuries and privilege for granted because to me this is as close as possible to a utopia as it gets.\n\nThank you for reading my very long rant. I hope you understand that it comes from a place of great admiration and gratefulness to Switzerland and it's people and I'd love to hear any differing opinions or maybe some worse parts about this beautiful country that I may not notice due to seeing it from the eyes of a foreigner\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your very thorough and understanding comments ! I have read all of them and wanted to say that I do understand that this complaining is what drove Switzerland to this point and I wish back home our voices were heard (God do we also love to complain). It may not all be sunshine and rainbows over here but it's pretty good I would say: thanks to the swiss peoples efforts.\n\nAnd back home it's not all bad either, but I wish we could go back go how it was one day, perhaps better.\n\nThanks again for all the replies, I'm very glad I live here now and am grateful for this country and it's people who have been nothing but welcoming to me.",

(Not sure even about the C permit, if one might have to leave the country if referendum passes)\n\nSurely there must be others thinking about it.\n\nI apologize if it has already been answered in another post.\n\nEdit: I assume that banks wouldn’t give out mortgage loans to B or C permit holders if there was any such risk, but you never know",

      "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nSo I currently like in a WG me and one other tenant have the main contract with the agency (they require 2 people), and there are 2 sub tenants. \n\nOn the 14th December I gave word to the agency and to all my roommates that I would be leaving at the end of February/1st March. \nIt was accepted by everyone and the hunt for a new tenant began. We found someone who would move into my room and take the main contract agreement. \n\nIn the meantime I moved out the country earlier in January (still paying the rent and managing the bills for everyone, and planned to do so until the end of February). \n\nIn the time I’ve been away (but still in contact) the agency had a meeting with the tenants and wanted to kick everyone out, the dynamic wasn’t working and the agency received many complaints and issues from the tenants. They convinced the agency to give them one last chance and they agreed. There can be one more main tenant change and that was it. \n\nDue to the issues the guy who was supposed to take over for me backed out at the last minute. \n\nI am supposed to go back to Switzerland at the end of February to pack up the last of my stuff- and I was supposed to hand over the WG bank account and everything since my notice is up and I’m officially moving on out of the country. \n\nThe subtenant came to me and has said he doesn’t trust the remain main tenant with the money (which isn’t my concern from the 1st March). The other sub tenant has now handed her notice in also due to the toxic environment in the apartment. \n\nA new tenant has been found for my room and will move in from the 1st of March and they think they found someone for the other room but on the 1st of May. My roommates have insisted that I continue to pay all the bills for them until then and I have refused since I’m not in the country nor will I be living at the apartment (or paying bills myself). \n\nI’ve now contacted the agency and they’ve informed me that until a new main tenant is found I’m responsible for the apartment. Is this true? Can I be forced to continue managing bills for 4 grown adults, even though I have over a 3 month notice that I would be leaving? \n\nI’m pregnant also and have had some complications so I’m also do not need the stress of this apartment drama. The other main tenant refuses to pay bills to me on time and it’s a lot of hassle running everything. Especially now that I’ll be out of the country and not living there. \n\nIs there anything the agency can do against me in this situation?",

This behavior for both cards has been consistent each time I have tried, on two occasions over a week's time.\n\nI have contacted one of the two banks, and they confirmed that the transaction is failing before it even gets to them.\n\nSo, does SBB just not accept transaction from the US?\n\nUPDATE:  \nI reached out to SBB via their chat service, and they recommended I book my international itinerary (Lausanne to Lyon) with SNCF. While all journeys from Geneva onward for my day of travel are already sold out, I was able to book from Évian-les-Bains to Lyon with no issues. Now I get a nice trip across Lake Geneva from Lausanne prior to the final train leg of my journey.

With all the money these banks have they can't come out with a simple, secure system? \n\nFor those who don't know when you request online banking (because you must request it, after all Switzerland is still stuck in 1965), you receive a letter with a matrix QR code. You must then download two apps (depending on your bank) one to allow the other app to recognize you. You must then go online, use your info, then download another app that allows you to scan the QR code from the letter, you then receive an activation code that allows you to log in.\n\nYou must repeat this process everytime you get a new phone!! \n\nNot to mention if you're using Migros Bank and you make the mistake of registering your online banking on your home computer and you're on the other side of the world and want to make a payment on your cellphone (you know, like it was 2024) you can't, because you have to accept the payment on your home computer!!\n\nThe problem with Switzerland is that the country has a lot of wealth but zero imagination. So they're perpetually stuck in the past. Even when a new updated app comes out it's already outdated. \n\nTake Paypal for example. You can send 100k to somebody with the touch of a button. You just open an account and you're ready to go. No letters, no QR codes, no activation codes, no 2nd device acceptance. \n\nSorry for the rant, im trying to send some money to myself but can't because I have a new phone, and don't have the 35 pieces of paper necessary to log into my account.\n\nCP",

What I more scared of is that probably they can say: \"Hey January 2019 is missing\" here is the 2K bill. \"Hey March 2017 is missing\", you owe us another 2K.  \nI have no idea nor proof to check if this is right or wrong.\n\nJust to be clear, I am not asking for legal help.   \n  \nI will probably pay and in the new year I will ask to my lawyer, I am asking if someone got in a similar problem and how did it go.\n\nEdit:\nThey say if I don't pay as soon as possible they will cancel my contract at the end of the month.\n\nIt is not really nice to receive a letter in which they state they are kicking you out end of the month because of a missing payment.

Ideologically most of us youngsters were against this in the first place, but then [whoops, it's actually going to put us in the red starting in 2026](https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/les-depenses-de-l-avs-sont-inferieures-de-2-5-milliards-de-francs-annonce-la-confederation). Do we need to do another votation to reverse it now?\n\nAnecdote 2: 2nd pillar reform this weekend. I have a degree in an economics adjacent field, myself and several colleagues have tried our hardest to research this topic, yet we can't come to a conclusion at all. On the one hand, PS/SP makes a bunch of unsubstantiated claims that we don't need to reduce payments despite extending lifespans, and the only people who will profit are banks off our reduced payments [FR](https://www.sp-ps.ch/fr/non-a-la-reforme-de-la-lpp/)/[DE](https://www.sp-ps.ch/nein-zur-bvg-vorlage/). On the other hand, UDC/SVP says the funds are fucked without a 4.5% annual return (again, no working given at all) and we've got to do it [FR](https://www.udc.ch/actualites/publications/exposes/oui-a-la-reforme-de-la-lpp/)/[DE](https://www.svp.ch/aktuell/kampagnen/aenderung-des-bundesgesetzes-ueber-die-berufliche-alters-hinterlassenen-und-invalidenvorsorge-bvg-reform-der-beruflichen-vorsorge/). As much as the other merits (reduced lower bound for insured salary, consolidated across jobs, easier for older people to find work) appeal, I can't in good conscience vote for those if it means the 2nd pillar system falls apart or bankers profit off our losses. The official voting booklet didn't provide much more information for me either. \n\nIn addition to the CMV, if you can provide me decision making evidence for this weekend please do.",

Yes, the law, the Swiss Code of Obligations, says the follwing:\n\n[Art. 257e](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/en#art_257_e)\n\n>1 Where the tenant of residential or commercial premises furnishes security in the form of cash or negotiable securities, **the landlord must deposit it in a bank savings or deposit account in the tenant’s name**.  \n>  \n>2 In residential leases, the landlord is not entitled to ask for more than three months’ rent by way of security.\n\nA clause many are not aware about and some landlords, specially landlords subletting, are either not aware of or take advantage of clueless renters. It is btw. customary that the renter pays the deposit money directly into the rental deposit account running in his name.\n\nBy this time of the year you should have got a bank statement form the bank were the money is deposited (you will need it for tax declaration if you do one). If you have never got such a bank statement (exception you have a rental deposit insurance) then it is time to act and see that your rental deposit money is put in a save place as mandated by the law.

      "selftext": "Hey Redditors,\n\nI want to share my recent experience with an online scam attempt while trying to sell a pair of sports shoes on Tutti.ch. It’s a cautionary tale that might help others avoid falling into a scammer's trap.\n\nThe Setup\n\nI posted an ad on Tutti to sell my shoes, and not long after, I received a message from a potential \"buyer.\" They seemed legit at first, but things quickly took a strange turn. Instead of asking for more details about the shoes or arranging to meet, they insisted on completing the transaction through a delivery service and directed me to a website:\n\nhttps://post-ch.schweizer-delivery.live/206597651\n\nThe link looked convincing, as if it were related to Swiss Post, but I had a gut feeling something was off.\n\nWhy the Link Is Suspicious\n\nHere’s what raised red flags for me:\n\n1. Fake Domain: The URL mimicked Swiss Post but added unnecessary words (.schweizer-delivery.live). Official Swiss Post websites always use post.ch.\n\n\n2. Unusual Process: The buyer claimed I needed to \"confirm shipment\" or \"pay a delivery fee\" via this website, which doesn’t make sense for a standard buyer-seller transaction.\n\n\n3. Pressure Tactics: They were persistent and tried to rush me into using the site.\n\n\n\nHow These Scams Work\n\nHere’s how scammers typically exploit sellers:\n\n1. Fake Payment/Shipping Pages: They create a counterfeit page that looks real and ask you to enter sensitive details, like your credit card or banking info.\n\n\n2. Phishing for Personal Data: Even if you don’t pay, entering basic info like your email address could lead to identity theft or further scams.\n\n\n3. Malware Risks: Visiting fraudulent websites could expose your device to malware or spyware.\n\n\n\nHow I Avoided the Scam\n\nInstead of clicking blindly, I inspected the link and did some quick research. Here’s what I recommend:\n\n1. Verify URLs: Always double-check web links. A secure site will use an official domain (e.g., post.ch) and start with \"https.\"\n\n\n2. Use Safe Browsing Tools: Websites like VirusTotal or URLVoid can scan suspicious links for threats without exposing your device.\n\n\n3. Trust Your Instincts: If something feels off, it probably is. Genuine buyers rarely push for complicated processes.\n\n\n\nReporting the Scammer\n\nAfter recognizing it was a scam, I reported the user on Tutti and flagged the website as phishing through Google Safe Browsing. I also reached out to Swiss Post to let them know scammers were misusing their brand.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIf you’re selling online, here’s how to stay safe:\n\nStick to Cash or Trusted Platforms: Meet in person or use secure payment platforms like PayPal Goods & Services.\n\nBe Skeptical of Links: Legitimate buyers won’t ask you to visit third-party sites to complete a sale.\n\nProtect Your Info: Never share sensitive data unless you’re 100% sure of the platform’s legitimacy.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nScammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but staying vigilant can save you from a lot of trouble. If you’ve encountered similar scams, feel free to share your story here—together, we can spread awareness and make these platforms safer for everyone!\n\nStay safe out there,",

However I was a bit upset because of pausing for one year my studies for that. Then I learned about civilian service which was more optimized for students thanks to his flexibility. So now I'm thinking about doing that but I have a few questions :\n\n1. I understand that you have to do a bunch of missions of 26 days each of them until reaching 450 days, with the advantage of doing it until...37 years ! Is it correct ?\n\n2. As I said, I don't want to gap a year to interrupt my studies. Plus, I have a conflict of conscience with the sleep deprivation. So my question is...do we sleep better in civilian service lol?\n\n3. If there is some people who did that, have you ever had conflict with your employers ? I know it is forbidden to be fired but I know also that in reality it's a bit nuanced so I want to have your experiences, is it (really) okay for employers? I want to work as wealth management, probably in a bank just for precision.\n\n4. For the one who did it, do the missions are intense, difficult or okay?\n\n5. I am very repulsed by bodily fluids like vomit or feces, so can I choose assignments where I will never have to endure this?\n\nThank you all in advance for your responses and can't wait to read all of them !",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI was hoping for some advice on an issue I'm having with wincasa. Basically, both myself and my partner received letters from Wincasa stating that we owe 290 CHF on our rent, and if we don't pay it within 30 days, they will terminate our rental agreement.\n\nI emailed them to ask for where this amount is missing from and they stated it was from Julys invoice.\n\nI started using Post finance in June and have a bank statement from them showing my rent paid in June and July. Julys payment was send out on 19June24, therefore it should have been accredited to their account well before 01July24. \n\nI emailed them with proof of the payments for both months. I got a response back that June's rent is fine, but July still has a remaining amount of 290 CHF. I referred them back to the proof of payment (post finance statement) which shows Julys payment being debited on 19June24\n\n Since then, I have heard nothing back from them. I have emailed them a bunch of times to ask for a response as to why I apparently owe this amount. I also attempted to call them and was left unanswered for 40 minutes. \n\nI'm beyond frustrated that no one is responding to me as I've paid all of my rent on time, and I know it's up to date. So if this is for something other than rent I would like to know so I can pay it. \n\nI'm coming here for advice on how I proceed? Is it possible to go to the local gemeinde and file a complaint with Wincasa? Or should I send them an official complaint directly with photocopies of my bank statements? \n\nSorry for the long post, I am spiraling with stress wondering what to do in this situation as I've never had dealings like this with any rental agency before. \n\nUpdate:\n\nThanks for all of the advice. I appreciate all of your help! I'll post a further update and let you know how everything goes disputing the bill. Wish me luck\n\nFurther update:\n\nI went to their office today to dispute the payment. They informed me that when we moved into the apartment in March, that month was free minus the operating costs (290 CHF). I explained to them that I had never received any information about this bill previously and wondered why they never sent this bill when it was due, instead just sent a threatening letter 4 months after it was apparently supposed to be paid. They had no answer as to why it was only sent in July. They apologised as it was an issue on their side, having not sent the letter for this bill or highlighted it at all until now.\n\nThey are an extremely unorganized company and I regret renting a property from them. But I've the bill paid now so hopefully that's the last I have to interact with them until I decide to move out. ",

      "selftext": "Dear hivemind,\n\nI have a family with 3 kids and we are currently thinking of buying a house. We found a relatively cheap 6 room house within 20 minutes of Basel, where I work. The property costs 950k, is from 1998 and in pretty decent condition. We have enough savings and income and the financing of the bank looks decent. There is no particular stress so we can even wait till December when the central bank will probably decrease the key interest rates to 0.75% to get a long time mortgage with good interest rate. So long so good.\n\nIf there was not the comment of Martin Schleger on Wednesday that the house market of Switzerland is totally off, what I am genuinely the opinion as well. Our family has a gross income of approx. 230k a year, what is significantly above median in Switzerland, still we can barely afford a house. This says a lot about the market and that it is mainly dominated by investors and not normal people. On top of that, many baby boomers will die/sell their property in the coming years. The chances are pretty high that there will be a sudden or slow correction in the coming years. The deal is pretty good as even with the 950k, we could still save money compared to renting a property but I would really bite my ass if we would buy a house now and in 15 years when we paid off the second mortgage, the property would be worth barely 600k.\n\nWhat do you think? Is the Swiss housing market cooling down significantly soon or is it just the same gibberish as it was 15 years ago? \n\nBest regards,\n\nd.",

      "selftext": "What do you think, are the distribution of the responsibilities between the federation and the cantons adequate ([see constitutions](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/404/en)) or should something be changed? Or have we actually found the perfect balance after 176 years of fine tuning?\n\nRemember also, that several federal institutions are not located in Bern but at other places. Like the federal courts (Lausanne, Lucerne, St. Gallen, Bellinzona), National Bank (Zurich and Bern), Federal Universities (Lausanne and Zurich), and several WSL and Agroscope sites all over the country.\n\nEdit: Historically the cantons had all the power. Including own military and currency. Then,  with the formation of the modern federal state, the cantons vested some of their power into the federation. By the Swiss constituition, any power not specifically given to the federation is with the cantons.\n\nOver the time, the responsibility of the federation grew and things where harmonized more and more. Example in the early days of the Automobile each canton had its own set or rules and laws. Even up to Grison where private cars where forbidden on the public roads. Up to 1942 each canton had its own criminal law, and up to 2011 its own criminal procedure code. \n\nSome other harmonization efforts are done by the cantons themselves where they agree on common procedures through a so called [Concordate](https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/fr/articles/009601/2008-10-28/)/[Konkordat](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interkantonales_Konkordat).

Investing in a 3a pillar with Generali (I already have one with my bank)\n\n2. Investing in a 3b pillar with SwissLife\n\n3. Changing my health insurance for another to save money (I already refused this one, because the hospital I prefer to go to isn't covered)\n\n  \nI read before that creating 3rd pillar with insurance company is a bad idea, so that got me cautious, but can anyone explain me why ? The whole lot seems really sketchy, promising me a lot of money when I retire but I know that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\n  \nThanks for your help !",

They recently got approached by an insurance agent and he’s trying to get them to sign a 3a life insurance plan. \n\nBefore I even moved to Switzerland about a year ago, I started reading up on how things work, bureaucracy, insurance plans, savings, pension and other topics, and saw that the general consensus is that life insurance 3a is a scam, and is not the most feasible option in most cases. My family are leaning towards signing the offer, and they’re trying to get me into a consult with the agent as well. Could someone give me suggestions on the list of questions I could ask the agent that could potentially convince my mother and brother to opt out of this plan and show them that there are better options out there?\n\nMy mom’s main argumentation was the fact that even if you end up disabled at some point, the insurance is going to continue covering the monthly installments for the 3a life insurance. \n\nI’ve tried telling her about options like doing it with a bank or other options like Finpension, but she didn’t sound convinced. \n\nI’m going to the consultations to humor her, but would like to take the opportunity to ask the agent questions that could potentially demonstrate that there are better options out there. \n\nThanks!",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI wanted to share my experiences, fully acknowledging my bias, but hoping it might be of use to someone!\n\n**About me**: I'm Swiss, in my late 30s to early 40s, holding a Master's and a PhD from ETHZ/EPFL. I spent 10 years working at a financial company where everything seemed fine until I was let go last year. After about a year of unemployment, I'm about to start a new role in a few days.\n\n**Being Fired**: The dismissal was somewhat anticipated, yet it was still a shock when they laid off half of the workforce. My only regret is that leaving wasn't my choice. I should've exited sooner, once the problems became evident, instead of trying to salvage an increasingly hopeless situation.\n\n**Unemployment:** The process was fairly streamlined, mostly online, with a decent advisor. They encouraged attending courses (CV writing, networking). I was required to apply for 8 jobs per month and as long as you check off the requirements and document everything diligently, and attend meetings on time, there were no issues.\n\n**Courses and Training:** I participated in CV writing, networking, and mock interview sessions and seminars. Surprisingly, the most beneficial was a general course attended by people from all walks of life (waiters, administrative staff, engineers...). Another, aimed at higher executives, was a waste of time.\n\n**Job Search**: It was an utter nightmare. Hours can be spent looking through job listings. The response rate is discouraging and the timing plays a big role. For instance, I had only a few unsuccessful interviews from July to December, and suddenly in January, I was in the running for 4 positions, with no new prospects since.\n\nFor me, LinkedIn was essential, and investing in a Premium subscription was almost a necessity, primarily for the ability to message people I wasn't connected to.\n\n**Networking**: This is crucial. Being known or having connections is vital in a competitive market. Almost all of my significant interviews came through my network.\n\n**The Job Market**: Specifically in finance, it's extremely tough. Major banks like UBS/CS were not hiring, limiting market fluidity. With layoffs common, those employed are staying put, making companies hesitant to hire. When they do, they're inundated with high-quality applications, allowing them to be highly selective.\n\n**Securing an Offer:** Ultimately, an acquaintance at a major bank contacted me about a vacancy. After 3 interviews in as many weeks, I received and accepted their offer. Though the position was listed on their website, I'm uncertain if they considered anyone else.\n\nIn conclusion, everything worked out, but the duration it took to secure a new position was astonishing!",

      "selftext": "Very few things can make a founder more excited than the news of their company's registration. That was the case for me recently when I received a confirmation message from my notary.\n\nNext morning, I ran to my post box to look for the registration certificate and instead found a bill to be paid for the completion of the registration. Indeed, we have to pay the incorporation fees to the Canton upon registration so the timing was right. \n\nHowever, I noticed a small remark on the letter concerning the ongoing fraud  bills that are sent to new company owners which do not come from public authorities. \n\nI did a bit of online research. It so happens that upon incorporation, your company's details get published online with the registration date.. it's very easy to get the list of every single company incorporated everyday. So anyone can take that list and send a fake bill to each of them asking them to pay the incorporation fees in their bank account. And they send it immediately.. so that their bill reaches the owner ahead of the real bill from the Canton.\n\nSo I got a bit more curious. I took a closer look at the letter.. that remark even mentioned that these fraud bills look very real. I got even more intrigued when I realized scanning the bill over and over  again that there was no mention of any public service of the Canton on this bill. Infact, had no phone number, no address, no contact details whatsoever!! Just the bill with qr code and a bank account of Credit Suisse in the name of some weird company.. \n\nAh, the letter asked to be pay with 7 days (before the owner gets the genuine bill)\n\nI looked at the letter one last time and the remark again..  advising to be careful of the fake bills out there which look very real.. \n\nWell, this fake bill didn't even look so real after all\n\n\nEDIT: I have decided to pay this bill with 10 cents in amount and some nice words in the message from the payee",

Thats why i would love to work in this field.\n\nNow my question is what would be the best way to get into it. Right now i have 2 ideas.\n\n1: Go and get my bachelor in Buisnes administration (Banking and finance) while working which would take 4 years and i would lose about 120'000 in salary over these years. Then after that do the master which would take 1 year and i would be done at around 27. Maybe if i need it i can do the CFA (Charterd Financial Analyst) then.\n\n2: I would do an HF as Dipl. Betriebswirtschafter HF which would take 3 years and i can Work fulltime while doing it so i dont lose any salary which i could invest (which i do). As a Sidenot the Dipl. Betriebswirtschafter HF has the same Standing as an offical Bachelor. After i completed the HF i could do the Dipl. Betriebswirtschafter NSD HF Which is basically a master for it which would again take 1 year. I would be done at around 26-27 and then could do the CFA aswell.\n\nNow my question is which one is better to get into the Financial field and also be able to work on something interesting for example portfolio Mangament. And would there be a better Way that i didnt think of yet. Thanks in advance for any Help!",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone, 👋\nIt's been a year since I put some money into cryptocurrencies. I invested a bit above 10k and as the bull run started I have some unrealized gains. This made me think if I should report this at the end of the year while doing my taxes. I am also wondering what would be the smartest move in order not to pay more taxes than I should. The assets I have are mostly on my cold wallet, I didn't do much trading, mostly hodled. I didn't liquidate any of the coins to my bank account neither. Also, I am wondering if there are any specificities for Geneva canton when it comes to this matter. \nI will really appreciate all the advice from you who had experience regarding this issue. Cheers!",

      "selftext": "**Swiss director Milo Rau officially opened the 58th Bitef tonight, and in his address to the audience in Madlenijanum, he also spoke about the fight against lithium mining in Serbia.**\n\nThis year's festival, which is held under the slogan \"Beauty will change the world\", began with the dance performance \"Softening\" by the Dance On Ensemble from Berlin, and Swiss director Milo Rau declared Bitef open before this performance.\n\nHis play \"Antigone in the Amazon\", which is on Bitef next week, deals with the struggle of the Brazilian Farmers' Movement - against modern mining companies. In his address, the director also spoke about the importance of the fight against lithium mining in Serbia.\n\n\"When I was at Bitef for the first time, exactly 10 years ago, in 2014, I drove through the former Yugoslavia in a small Volkswagen. This morning, when I arrived here, I heard that someone else arrived in Serbia this summer in a Volkswagen - it was German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He came to promote the mining of lithium for the needs of the German automobile industry, not far from here, in the Jadra valley. Solz called on Serbs to make sacrifices for Europe, for so-called 'sustainable' energy. 'Europe' means, of course – Volkswagen. Displacement of 20,000 families and poisoning of fertile soil for future generations. Yes, that's what 'sustainable' means – sustainable in death,” said the director.\n\nHe added that he came to Belgrade \"with a Greek tragedy\".\n\n\"This time I didn't come to Belgrade in a Volkswagen, I came with a Greek tragedy: the piece Antigone in the Amazon, about the struggle of the Brazilian Movement of Landless Farmers (MST) against modern mining companies - about the struggle of Antigone, the Theban princess, against her uncle Creon, the Greek Olaf Scholz . The Amazon is 10,000 kilometers from here, but we live in a globalized world: the same tragedy, the same wasteland is everywhere. \"Like in a teenage monster movie, the same company, Rio Tinto, is mining lithium in Serbia and bauxite in the Amazon - minerals needed for a 'sustainable' future for Volkswagen,\" he said.\n\nHe said that he thinks - and that this is the message of Antigone - that it is better to defend our country.\n\n\"Antigone's fight is everywhere and her explicit NO to land grabbing is equally needed in Serbia as in Brazil. 'Beauty will save the world', a quote from Dostoyevsky's Idiot, is the theme of this year's Bitef. Chancellor Scholz, Volkswagen, Rio Tinto: they don't want to save the world, they want to save their power and their bank accounts. In all countries, whether it's Europe or Brazil, the very people who use the words nation and homeland the most - nationalists - will sell the beauty of their country to international investors. Yes, there is something terrible, monstrous, something horrible about us humans. Something that sometimes makes me feel the urge to sit up and scream. So please: let us all be like Antigone. Let's all be like Dostoyevsky's Idiot: let's be naive, say NO to the deadly ideology of our time. We are fighting for Beauty, for the Beauty of life, for the Beauty of nature - our true homeland,\" concluded the director.\n\nThe audience greeted the Swiss director's speech with loud applause and shouts.",

      "selftext": "I recently lost 200CHF due to what I believe is a security flaw in TWINT's system. Someone managed to steal my netbanking contract number and password, then used this information to create a second TWINT account linked to my bank.\n\nHere’s the kicker:\n\n* I already had a TWINT account on my phone, but they were still able to set up another one.\n* They used a different phone number, and TWINT didn’t require any ID verification or confirmation to the email address linked to my bank account.\n* I wasn’t notified at any point that a second TWINT account had been created.\n\nMy bank has contested the charges with TWINT, but TWINT is refusing any responsibility, claiming it’s my fault for having my info stolen.\n\nYes, I am at fault for having my netbanking account number and password stolen. However, without TWINT, the fraudster wouldn’t have been able to do anything because logging into my bank account requires confirmation through my bank's security app, even if they have my netbanking information.\n\nMy bank is now sending me a new contract number so I can safely reaccess my account, but when I asked if it was possible to completely block my account from creating a TWINT account in the future, they told me this wasn’t possible. How can I prevent this from happening again if I can’t disable TWINT account creation?\n\nThe bank told me to file a police report, but the police said it likely won’t lead to anything.\n\nI’m frustrated and feel helpless. Has anyone else dealt with this? Any advice? At the very least, I hope this raises awareness about how vulnerable TWINT accounts seem to be.\n\nEdit : Since a lot of people have been asking, my bank is the BCN (Banque cantonale neuchâteloise)",

(I don't expect them to deliver justice for normal people... but not even for banks?)\n\nZurich's prosecutors knew about the extortion since 2014, yet they didn't do anything. \n\nEspecially embarrassing: there were two (alleged) offenders. One lives in Switzerland, one in Germany. The Germans have convicted \"their\" guy in 2019 and he had to pay his share of the extorted money back. Whereas the Swiss didn't even investigate \"their\" guy, thus he can keep his share of the extorted money (more than half a million) and faces no punishment.\n\nImagine... the German justice system is better prepared to get extroted money back for a bank in Switzerland than the Swiss justice system.\n\nSource: [https://www.srf.ch/news/wirtschaft/steuerbetrug-cum-ex-zuercher-justiz-laesst-erpresser-laufen](https://www.srf.ch/news/wirtschaft/steuerbetrug-cum-ex-zuercher-justiz-laesst-erpresser-laufen)",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nOn this subreddit, money comes up all the time and there are always questions about how to budget, what to do with one's money and how to track all this.\n\nI created a (pretty basic) template for people to get started with controlling their own finances and would like to show you how I use it.\n\n# The Google Sheets Template\n\nHere is the template I created:\n\n* 🇬🇧 [English Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YtdVyIP-iCqFENGm2JO8EQypAjJlcznHphWz49bc1R8/edit?usp=sharing)\n* 🇩🇪 [German Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rmdu9mSXj56stJcRReWCNXL1YE7wyfk2Aoh1niAKXNc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTo start, read the first sheet \"Overview\" and fill in your data in the \"Config\" sheet. Then just look at the other Sheets and start to crunch the numbers.\n\nIf you are just here for the template, great! But if you are interested in how I use the template and how I generally handle my finances, read on below:\n\n# Why knowing your finances is important\n\nMoney is a topic that you will have to deal with for your whole life, so a few years ago I wanted to “get it” and implement a system for how I deal with money as early as possible. I see it as a kind of investment, where for each year that I have figured out my finances, I am less stressed and can focus on more important things for the rest of my life.\n\n# Step 1: tracking your daily expenses\n\nTracking where your money goes is the base layer of a healthy finance life and you need the low-level data to properly analyse your spendings and to get some insight about your finances.\n\nI personally use an [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realbyteapps.moneymanagerfree&hl=en_US&pli=1) to track my expenses since \\~5 years, but I know of people that just look at the monthly history in their eBanking (some have even automated the data transfer from eBanking to Excel).\n\n# Step 2: documenting your finances monthly\n\nAlways on the first day of a new month, I open up my finance file and transfer all my tracked spendings (the sums per category) from the app in to the file.\n\n1. **Spendings**: I fill in all my income for this month (Salary, selling stuff, dividends, etc.; I track this as well in my app) and then fill out the costs (I differentiate between fixed and variable costs).\n2. **Networth**: I go in to all my accounts (eBanking, Pillar 2, Pillar 3a, Revolut, etc.) and count my cash and all my other valuables and insert the current value for this month. This way you have a wonderful detail of your (hopefully growing) networth.\n\n# Step 3: reviewing your costs from time to time\n\nIn the sheet \"Costs\", the categories are the same as in \"Spendings\". For each category you fill in the monthly cost (estimate or if you have entered some data already, use the average from \"Spendings\")  and then calculations are made to show you **how much you pay for this daily/monthly/weekly**. If you have done your configurations in \"Config\", you will also find in the last three columns **how much you work for each category** (hours per month/days per month/days per year).\n\nCheck how you feel about the amount you spend on each category and if you are okay with working as long as you actually work to finance your expenses.\n\n*I got this \"how long am I working to finance category x\" from the great book* [*Your Money Or Your Life*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139674222-your-money-or-your-life)*. It is about how you value your work time and how people's relationship with their job and the resulting salary can be looked from different perspectives.*\n\n# Step 4: investing surplus money\n\nIf I have some money left at the end of the month, I use it in this order:\n\n1. Paying off debt\n   1. Debt is negative wealth and it should be your **first priority** to pay it off to not get overwhelmed by recurring interest charges.\n2. Building up your emergency fund\n   1. You want to have an emergeny fund for unexpected payments, if you suddenly lose your job or you get ill etc.. The amount in this account should make you sleep comfortably knowing that you have a backup in case something goes wrong. Normally people speak about **3-12 times your monthly** ***costs***.\n3. Saving x% of your income for bigger expenses\n   1. Once your emergency fund is established, you can start to **pay yourself monthly**. You do this by transferring x% of your paycheck to your savings account as soon as your paycheck arrives (preferably with a standing order in your eBanking).\n4. Investing into your Pillar 3a.\n   1. If you still have money left, now it’s time to invest it. The Pillar 3a can be deducted from tax, that's why **I prefer to max out the amount in the Pillar 3a before I move on to other investments**. Since the money you pay into the Pillar 3a is left untouched until retirement (under normal circumstances), you have a long time horizon for your investments and therefore want to invest as much as possible (if you are closer to retirement you want to go down with your investments, but if you are young – go high). For example I invest 99% of my Pillar 3a into ETFs (no fancy strategies, just what my Pillar 3a offers).\n5. Investing the surplus into a broad, low cost ETF\n   1. If you STILL have money left, congrats to you, you’ve come a long way and have a good and thriving finance life. Now you need to invest the money on your own. This is a very very very big topic and there are different philosophies as how to invest. I would really advise you to  inform yourself and learn a thing or two about how the stock market works. General consensus for newbies in Swiss forums like [Mustachianpost](https://forum.mustachianpost.com/) or \n   2.  seems to be to just buy the [VT ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) via [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php). But please don't just do what I tell you here, **inform yourself and do your own due diligence!**\n\n--\n\nThanks for reading, if you have some feedback or additional ideas, let me know!\n\n*This is a summary from a post on my own personal (non-commercial)* [*blog*](https://roufri.com/how-i-handle-my-finances/)*.*\n\n*If you want some more details and further resources about this topic, look at the blog post or write me a message.*",

This is my first purchase and I don’t have much experience in real estate in general and I also don’t have people around me who can help me, so I need you, Redditors to help me with this decision!!\n\nThe property I am about to buy is a small 2.5-room apartment in the city. This is a new construction and the developer has put us in touch with a broker who takes care of the financing. In short, he helped me a lot for that because my file was on the verge of passing and he multiplied the requests before finally finding me a bank that would finance the purchase. He also immediately told me about indirect depreciation in insurance (PAX) however I am doubtful about the usefulness of such insurance or even its profitability. So of course, this will save me taxes but my interest will not decrease and I will always pay the same amount especially since the first 2 years of insurance contributions are lost because they are used to insure my amortization in case of illness or death.\n\nIs it really profitable to take out this kind of insurance or is it better to make a direct depreciation? Can more experienced people enlighten me on it?\n\nThank you,",

As far as I know, only some US tech companies and hedge funds can afford it. And US tech companies are hard to get hired because they are very small in Switzerland, except for Google (which is still freezing hiring).\n\nFor me, I don't like the working environment in banks very much, and prefer working in tech companies because they are more free and challenging. However, I don't see many opportunities and I'm worried that my career path will be away from tech companies. I want to go to the US because there are more opportunities there, but I don't want to apply for a master's degree just to work there. My friends told me to go to the UK and the Netherlands to look at US tech companies. I'm hesitant because I have a Swiss permanent residence permit, and if I leave Switzerland for more than half a year, my permanent residence permit may be revoked. So I would like to ask someone who can give me some advice.\n\nThank you in advance.\n",

I managed clients' needs across various areas, including insurance, fund placements, and financial investments. I was also ranked among the top 10 consultants in Switzerland during my time in this field.\nI am now actively looking to transition into the banking sector. Despite my motivation and many applications, l've been facing repeated rejections. I believe this might be due to my background being considered \"unconventional\" for this industry. I'm considering enrolling in an online BBA (Bachelor in Business Administration) to strengthen my profile. I believe this could provide me with a more relevant foundation for the banking sector.\nMy question for you:\n• Do you think an online BBA would significantly improve my chances of breaking into banking?\n• Do you have any other suggestions to help me make this career shift successfully?\nThank you for your time and advice.",

At the time I thought the seller probably bought a bunch of them in bulk and didn't bother unboxing them. After opening the box, there was no invoice or anything sketchy, and the item was new.\n\n- This week I received per post a letter from brack stating I owe them 649.-. I checked my emails, and could not find any purchases from their store. Since this letter only stated that I owed them the money, I contacted them, asking for more details as to what item this was refering to. And TaDaa! It was exactly the item I had bought on tutti.\n\n\n\n*Some more important details*\n\n- I paid with twint and have the seller's phone number (probably linked to a bank account in their name?)\n\n- Their tutti profile \"BTCB STORE\" is now empty (used to have 20+ articles all the time)\n\n- In order to be covered by warranty, I asked the seller for the purchasing invoice, which they provided and blanked some details like price. **This document contains their name and address** (which I don't know if they are real or not). \n\n\n\n*Questions*\n\nSince this is my first time getting scammed, I have no idea what to do now. Brack keeps asking for money for an item which I have not willingly purchased from them. Additionally, I have gifted the item to my girlfriend and it is not longer in my possession. \n\nWhat should I do?? Pay brack? Let them handle it themselfes?\n\n\n\nHow can I prevent something like this to happen in the future? I feel like there is nothing I could have done, this person had my name and address. They probably ordered from brack with their email, but to my name and address, got the invoice per email and I received the item.\n\n  \nThank you everyone for your help\n\n  \nTL;DR\n\n[tutti.ch](http://tutti.ch) seller odered an item in my name and with my address on [brack.ch](http://brack.ch), probably received the invoice on their email, I paid the seller and now the store saying I owe them money.",

Did anyone have an experience with similar situations?\n\nThe reason I am asking is because we are on the verge of purchasing an apartment. However, most probably the mortgage and the purchase agreement will be completed in January with an agreed date to take over the purchased apartment on 1 of March. The bank consultant gave us an assurance that most probably the mortgage will be approved.\n\nIf we cancel our current rental agreement by the end of December it will be within the agreed termination period to leave the apartment at end of March. It means we would have 1 month overlap (basically none in terms of payment) and we wouldn't go into the trouble to find a replacement.\n\nThe risk is that the mortgage and the purchase agreement are not concluded by the end of March to take over the purchased apartment. Is it worth running the risk, or it is better to wait until everything is completed and then cancel the rent with a task to find replacement and paying double costs?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

      "selftext": "I’m curious about how disconnected (or not) house prices are from bank valuations (as in, the valuation done by the bank when applying for financing to buy the property). For anyone who has bought (or tried to buy) a property in Switzerland, by how much did the actual sale price differ from the bank’s valuation of the property?\n\nFor example (totally arbitrary numbers):\n- house is on the market for 1.2 M CHF\n- bank values house at 1 M CHF\n- house sells for 1.1 M CHF\n* so the house sold for 10% more than the bank’s valuation \n\nMy understanding is that banks in Switzerland use 2 main models to value properties, and the valuation takes into account recent local sales prices - which to some extent should therefore account for local supply/demand balance, although I don’t know how up-to-date and precise their models are. Then the bank is prepared to finance a percentage of the valuation that they gave, like 70 or 80% (not sure of the numbers here, please feel free to correct me). \n\nAlso, if there was a significant difference, what do you think were the drivers of that difference? Obviously something like a bidding war on a property would drive up the sales price, so I’m not looking to supply/demand factors - I’m curious about other situations where a bank genuinely under or overvalued a property and why that might be. Are there systemic issues in the valuation models used?\n\nThanks!\n\nPS I appreciate that more than 60% of people (myself included) are renting, I’m just curious how this works after I overheard some people complaining about not getting enough financing. I’ve always thought house prices make buying here pretty unattainable, but this seems to make it even worse if it’s true… :/",

      "selftext": "I hear you, not another Trump post! \n\nAlso, sorry for the clickbait, the case is most likely not curious at all. Anyway, here goes:\n\n**What happened?**\n\nSo, I stumbled upon this [article](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/swiss-national-bank-bought-trump-media-shares/). The author, Walker Davis, was apparently scanning a filing of the SNB, where they have to declare all of their US stock holdings as of September 30 2024.\n\nAnd this is what he saw, among the 2'465 stocks with a total value of 154bn USD:\n\n*TRUMP MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY GRO, Value: 1,788,591, Shares: 111,300*\n\nThe SNB bought 111k shares of Trump's company (DJT), worth 1.8m USD. Scandalous?!\n\nTrump Media was first listed on the US stock exchange in late 2021, so I clicked through all SNB 13-F filings going back to Q4 2021 to confirm that this was actually the first time they reported a holding in Trump Media. And this is correct.\n\n**So why did this purchase happen? And why now?**\n\nThe SNB pursues a market-neutral and passive investment approach by replicating individual equity markets in their entirety. Meaning, they buy an individual stock if it grows (in respect to the total market) and sell a stock if it shrinks, without any more consideration (i.e. no active management is happening).\n\nIf you look at the [share price development](https://i.imgur.com/oMQ7MtS.png), the stock IPO'd in late 2021 as a [SPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-purpose_acquisition_company) called \"Digital World Acquisition Corp.\" (DWAC). Trump Media went public on March 26 2024, by merging with DWAC.\n\nIt's not exactly clear to me why SNB's index-weighted portfolio didn't pick up a position in DWAC in early 2022, as the share price was much higher, albeit only for a very short period of time. [**edit:** many thanks to /u/LeroyoJenkins for pointing out that SPACs are often excluded from indexes!]\n\nThe upwards movement of the stock price in the first half of 2024 is probably the reason why DJT was included in SNB's portfolio in Q3 2024.\n\n**What will SNB do next with DJT**\n\nSNB is about to report their Q4 2024 filings with the SEC in the next few days. Looking at the stock price development in Q4, the size of the DJT position will likely remain about the same. Stay tuned!\n\n**Q&A-Section:**\n\n*Q*: Why does the SNB hold US stocks in the first place?\n\n*A*: To make money, duh!\n\n*Q*: Where can I find SNB's 13-F filings?\n\n*A*: [Voila.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=Swiss+National+Bank+&match=starts-with&filenum=&State=&Country=&SIC=&myowner=exclude&action=getcompany)\n\n*Q*: What exemptions does the SNB set itself when replicating equity markets?\n\n*A*: The SNB refrains from investing in shares of systemically important banks and Swiss issuers (due to potential conflict of interests). They also exclude companies that seriously violate fundamental human rights, systematically cause severe environmental damage or are involved in the production of internationally condemned weapons.\n\n**edit**: ugh, ugly typo in the title... it should read  *the Swiss National Bank's investment*",

If all is good to go, then we exchange ownership paper and we transfer the money at a bank branch (in cash) or something like TWINT!\nMy main concern is the process of checking if the bike is not crashed/damaged and repaired to look in good shape!

      "selftext": "Hey\n\nI finally want to get around to finish my tax declarations for 2024 in Winterhur (Zürich). I've extended the deadline early enough to end of November, as that's the maximum possible (in normal ways; it's been acknowledged and so that's taken care of).\n\nSo… The normal Swiss stuff is easy and I've done. However where I struggle is the following: In '24 my father died; let's say it was the 4 July 2024 (it was not). He lived in Germany; I live in Winterthur. I inherited it all, ie. some investment fonds.\n\nWhat do I need to fill in…?\n\nSpecifically at \"Erhaltene Schenkungen / Erbschaften\" (\"*Gifts / inheritances received*\") (see also [screenshot](https://ibb.co/pBQtKfBz)), what's the Betrag (\"*amount*\")? Would I need to contact the bank where he invested and have them tell me, the total sum of the investment fond accounts as of 5 July '24 (1 day after his death)?\n\nWouldn't the Steueramt (\"*tax office*\") also like to know how the values of the investments developed until 31 December 2024? Should I get this information also from the bank in Germany in a form of a Kontoauszug (\"*bank statement*\") or such? Where to enter this then?\n\nIn the Wertschriftenverzeichnis (\"*securities register*\") ([screenshot](https://ibb.co/PZBSHhQC))? One entry per fonds?\n\nThat's how?\n\nThanks.",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI would like to get your opinion, after receiving a 500 CHF bill from an ambulance company following an \"intervention\" that happened without my consent during a festival.\n\nDue to a migraine (headache, nausea/vomiting), which was admittedly triggered by a bit of alcohol (I know it's a trigger, I’ve suffered from migraines for over 15 years, but in the heat of the moment...), I stepped aside with a friend while we waited for our Uber.\n\nSome medics came over and simply took my blood pressure and gave me a plastic bag for the taxi ride (which I paid for, we had to cancel our Uber, by the way), and of course took down my personal information. I didn’t receive any treatment, no transport, not even a glass of water. I even explicitly asked them to leave me alone.\n\nSeveral weeks later, I received this 500 CHF bill.  \nAccording to the invoice, they classified it as an “Emergency intervention and rescue” outpatient UP P2 (prehospital emergency P2).\n\nThis clearly seems abusive, doesn’t it?  \nThere was no emergency, I was conscious, with a friend, and didn’t request any help.\n\nThey don’t respond to emails, so I had to contact them via registered mail with return receipt.  \nThey refused to cancel or revise the bill, citing a call to 144 and claiming they simply followed procedure by “accompanying you while you waited for your transport.”\n\nI contacted my health insurance (Assura) a week ago to report the situation, but haven’t received a response either (I have the basic package with deductible of CHF 300. I am never ill (except migraines) and I have never claimed any reimbursement in 10 years, so I also asked if a favour is possible).\n\nDoes this seem fair to you?  \nWhat do you think I can do? I’m supposed to pay by August 9th.\n\nI'm not surprised we pay so much for health insurance, with this kind of overbilling going on...\n\nThank you for any advice you may have.\n\n**EDIT 1** :  \n*Thank you all for your advice. I will contact my legal insurance company and let you know what happens next.*\n\n**EDIT 2** :  \n*My legal insurance company informed me that this case is not covered by their policy, as it is not strictly a legal matter... They suggested that Assura might still cover the costs, and then they would offer a commercial gesture to pay the remainder if any, or at least part of it if Assura refuses to cover any cost.*\n\n*Also, just for the few comments that missed the point, I don't blame the paramedics, they're doing their job, I don't even blame the person who called 144 (even if I persist that anyone should have seen that it wasn't an emergency, I was with a friend, I was standing up, I was responding coherently, no shocks, no blood, nothing), I'm just stating that I didn't ask for anything and was never informed of the situation. They just came up to me, asked for my ID and took my blood pressure, that's all, without warning me about anything, and without me ever knowing that they weren't festival staff, otherwise of course I would have refused.*\n\n**EDIT 3** :  \n*OK, got some additional info from all parties, that was the medical staff on site who called the ambulance, maybe a mutual arrangement... but I understand better now, even though we didn't see it (location not accessible by car) it seems that an ambulance did indeed respond (I have no choice but to believe it anyway).*\n\n**EDIT 4** :  \n*End of story.*  \n*My health insurance will cover 50% of the costs (after deductible, which I will definitely use this year anyway). They cover 50% of an ambulance bill up to CHF 500 per year if there was no transport to a healthcare provider, or CHF 5,000 in the case of a rescue. They cannot legally make any commercial gestures. So CHF 250.*  \n*My legal insurance made a gesture and paid me CHF 200 (already received the bank transfer.).*  \n*So it's OK in the end, it will cost me CHF 50, let's say this corresponds to my share of responsibility in this story.*  \n*Thank you all for your time, take care of yourselves, but not too much of others ahah (joking) :)*",

      "selftext": "The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is set to close its 2024 financial year with a substantial profit of around 80 billion francs. After two years of no distributions, the SNB will allocate 3 billion francs to the confederation and the cantons.\n\nWe know that the SNB holds assets such as gold, foreign currencies, and stocks. However, these profits are largely \"on paper\" which leads me to my question: How exactly does the SNB distribute this money to the cantons and the confederation?\n\nWe'll the SNB liquidating a large portion of its assets to generate the 80 billion francs needed? Or is this more of an accounting operation? The latter seems plausible, but it raises questions about how these distributions are actually realized in practice.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts or insights on how the SNB's profit distribution process works, especially given the complexity of these accounting operations.",

So far had no issue with it. However, yesterday, a person approached me in front of the garage and gave me an envelope with my name on it. In the letter, they described that the building is sold and there is a new Spanish owner, and there is a new house management firm which will be looking after the property. That's all, and the bank details at the second page. This happened on the 1st of April (I know... but it wasn't a joke) with the ownership change dated 31st March. \n\nI called my previous management team, and they confirmed that indeed the building is sold and they are no longer managing it. \n\n* My main concerns are: I only had a contract with the old management firm, so shouldn't that be closed?  \n* I paid the rent for April already. The old management firm says that will be handled by them and I shouldn't be worried.\n* Can the new owner strike me with an unreasonable new contract? Am I obligated to take it?\n\n  \nI'm quite confused as at the moment I only have a contract with a firm which is not working with the property anymore. I no literally nothing about the new owners, no contract, no official document sent to me. In the meantime, the old firm says that this is normal and my contract will automatically be taken over by the new management. Is this true? Shouldn't I sign something for that? \n\nit   \nAny advice or feedback is more than welcome since this is the first time this has happened to me in Switzerland. ",

I’m wondering if anyone can offer alternative advice on how to get this issue resolved. \n\nEarlier in 2024 I joined the bank Cler. I liked the look of the app and it was better than my current bank. The bonus: 100chf Interdiscount voucher/giftcard. \n\nAt the start of December I used the voucher to order a HomePod mini for a Christmas gift. Shortly before Christmas Day I realised it would not arrive in time, but I accepted that these things happen and told the recipient their gift was delayed. \n\nIn January I received an email saying the supplier doesn’t have any black HomePod minis and they’re cancelling my order. Ok fair enough, but my voucher expired in 2024. So I’ve lost my 100chf. \n\nIt’s not a life changing amount of money, but finances are tight right now. It feels really unfair to have lost out because of supply chain issues that I have no control over. \n\nWhat frustrates me the most is the customer support emails I receive are completely uninformed and they ignore my response emails. The phone operators just say they’ll send an email to support which never goes anywhere. \n\nWould I have better success going to a store and complaining? Is there someone higher up I can email? Perhaps contact someone via LinkedIn?",

      "selftext": "Every time I get into this topic, I get so angry. A while ago I wanted to get access to an API to hook it up to a budgeting app or make my own, but as it turns out no bank in Switzerland has a direct API. The once that do have an API all use BLink by Six.\n\nBLink is basically useless, because it's only usable for businesses. So you as an individual have no way of sending a request to an API and get your own data back. My Money! My Data! I have a right to access these things however I want.\n\nSo I got curious and looked up how much it costs to be registered with six, so I could maybe crowdfund the initial cost, so I can provide an endpoint that people can use. I understand that this does in fact cost money and I have no issue with that. **The initial costs are 5k + 200.- CHF per month.** In my opinion, acceptable. That's not the egregious part.\n\nThe truly egregious part is they charge **PER API CALL**. For UBS the prices per API call are:\n\n**Account Information: 0.1.- CHF**  \n**Payment Submission: 0.15.- CHF**\n\nAnd the worst part is, **you can't even access everything**. You can't access your bank documents, you cannot access eBill, you can only access basic account information and submit payments. That's it! And for every one of those calls, they want to be paid between 0.1 and 0.15 francs. That is absolutely ridiculous.\n\n**Just to put this into context**, Reddit was flamed for its API changes where a thousand API calls cost 0.24 dollars. **This is almost a thousand times more.**\n\n**No Fintech can ever exist in this environment because of this.** You can never connect a budgeting app or anything like this, ever, because it's never going to be feasible. You would expect to make at least a couple of dozen API calls a day normally, but even if you limit it to 10 API calls per day, you're paying one franc per day per user. And that's without submitting any payments. That is ridiculous.\n\nSource:  \n[https://www.six-group.com/dam/download/sites/blink/annex4-pricelist-six-en.pdf](https://www.six-group.com/dam/download/sites/blink/annex4-pricelist-six-en.pdf)\n\n**An API is not a luxury for something like this.** It's a basic necessity and the fact that the banks do not provide it It's just not okay. There is not a single Swiss bank that provides an adequate API and They don't have to because there's basically no competition in this space.\n\n**Why is an IBAN not treated like a god-damn phone number?** Why cant I transfer it to a new bank just like I do with a phone number and a carrier? Its annoying. And I don't care about a technical explanation. It's a unique identifier, so I don't care how they created it, it can be transferred.   \nAnd before you says its not possible, the UK has a system that allows everything to be transferred easily. Maybe not the IBAN but everything else. So there is ways to do this.",

      "selftext": "The storyline is very similar to the one posted here a few days ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1iop6ep/almost\\_got\\_scammed\\_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Switzerland/comments/1iop6ep/almost_got_scammed_today/)\n\nI received a call from a Swiss number, **+41 ...** . I answered and heard a robotic voice say, *\"This is a federal investigation (...) For English, press 1.\"* I pressed 1.\n\nThe first person, **Lili Holms** (badge ID **LH 8052271**), spoke in a clear British accent and was very polite. Her story sounded convincing:  \n*\"This is a recorded call. Your Swiss ID has been linked to money laundering and drug trafficking in Mexico, Thailand, and other countries. A clone of your ID was found in an apartment in Bern, where authorities discovered 20g of cocaine, other drugs, and a large amount of cash.\"*\n\nShe then asked me to confirm the last three digits of my Swiss permit and my full name *\"to verify my identity so I can provide you with further details.\"*  \nI did. 🤦🏻‍♂️\n\nShe proceeded with seemingly reasonable questions—if I had rented a car in the past three months, if I had connected to public Wi-Fi, and if I had any photos of my ID stored in Google Photos, as that’s likely how I got hacked. She also asked if I had other bank accounts, where they were, and whether I could prove the source of my money and how I had spent it over the past six months.\n\n(Even though I always use a VPN and have had antivirus protection for years, I still fell for the *\"you've been hacked\"* narrative.)\n\nShe gave me a case number (**DN 007418**) and told me to keep it for the duration of the investigation. Then she transferred me to a colleague who would explain my options.\n\nThe second person, **Ronnie Ryan** (badge ID **RC 135806**), initially spoke in a clear English accent but added a sense of urgency to the conversation. He stressed that this was a recorded call that would be used as evidence in court. Then he escalated things:\n\n* In the next hour, my Swiss ID would be **suspended** to prevent criminals from acting on my behalf.\n* My Swiss **bank accounts would be frozen**, along with any others I had.\n* While under investigation, I would be **forbidden from making bank transfers** or speaking to anyone about this for the next 24 hours.\n\nHe insisted I take notes because *\"this is extremely important.\"* He continued building urgency, saying that within 24 hours, I would be **escorted by two Swiss police officers** for further interrogation.\n\nThen came the *\"good cop\"* part: he told me the Swiss government had reviewed my records, saw that I had a clean history, and wanted to **help me secure my financial assets** during the investigation. They would return everything afterward.\n\nThe more I interrupted with questions, the more his accent began to shift toward an Indian one. I told him I was shocked and found it incredibly difficult to believe this was happening.\n\nAt this point, I was both shocked and suspicious—but mostly shocked. To clear any doubts, he told me to Google the phone number **+33 4 72 44 70 00**, saying that Interpol would be calling me next because *\"money laundering is one of the most serious crimes in Europe.\"*\n\nSure enough, I got a call from a so-called *Interpol officer*. This guy was aggressive and blunt:  \n*\"I'm not here to empathize with you. I'm here to tell you what's happening and what your options are.\"*\n\nThen I was redirected back to **Ronnie Ryan**.\n\nAt this point, Ronnie sounded *fully Indian* and finally got to the real scam:  \nTo *\"secure my financial assets,\"* I had to either:\n\n1. Buy an **Apple Gift Card** or\n2. Transfer my money to a **crypto wallet** they provided.\n\nThey assured me I would get all my money back afterward.\n\nThat’s when they lost me. I told him I was **familiar with the gift card scam** and that Swiss authorities surely had **better ways to secure assets than Apple Gift Cards**.\n\nI told him I was going to my local police station and would contact a lawyer. If this were real, I expected the Swiss police to visit my home or send an official letter.\n\nRonnie immediately dropped the act and went full scammer mode—threatening that if I didn’t comply, I would be jailed for a minimum of 7 years and fined tens of thousands of Swiss francs.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nIndian scammers managed to get:\n\n* My **full name**\n* The **last three digits of my Swiss ID**\n* **How much money I have** in my bank accounts\n\nLuckily, they didn’t get any money from me. \n\n**Be aware!**",

I worked in Switzerland for almost 2 years, earning a gross monthly salary of around CHF 4,300 gross. I left the country about **4 and a half years ago**, and at the time, I was no longer working in Switzerland or contributing to the Swiss social security system.\n\nAfter leaving Switzerland, I **did not start working immediately**. I was unemployed for the **first 4–5 months**, during which I was not contributing to any other EU social security system either (including Portugal, where I moved). Only after that period did I start working and contributing to Portuguese social security.\n\nNow I’m wondering:\n\n* Do I still have the right to **withdraw my 2nd pillar in cash**?\n* Does the fact that I was **not working in the first 90 days** after leaving Switzerland help my case?\n* Am I still in time to request the money after 4.5 years?\n* What steps should I take to start this process (I believe my pension fund was managed by **Hotela** , and **Gastrosocial**  if that helps  )?\n* If not possible to get this money in cash at a bank account would still be able to transfer to another fund that I have in Portugal ?\n\nI've read that under the EU-Switzerland agreements, it's only possible to withdraw the LPP money in cash **if you're not contributing to a mandatory pension system in another EU country within 3 months** of leaving Switzerland. Is that really the deciding factor?\n\nAny help or insights from people who went through this or understand the system would be much appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

I’m thinking of leaving university to start one of the 18-month banking Bankeinstieg für Mittelschulabsolventen (german), Formation bancaire initiale pour porteurs de maturité(french) offered by UBS, BCV, Migros Bank, or Raiffeisen.\n\nI’m really curious if anyone here has done one of these programs or knows someone who has. I’d love to hear about your experience. After completing the traineeship, what kind of job opportunities opened up for you? What’s the salary range like? How realistic is it to climb the ranks within the bank after completing the program?\n\nI’m looking for practical experience and a stable job in the banking sector. Any insights or advice would be highly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit : I am talking about the Bankeinstieg für Mittelschulabsolventen (german), Formation bancaire initiale pour porteurs de maturité(french) ",

      "title": "Locative value and debt interests",
      "selftext": "Hi guys, I have a question regarding taxes and interests payment when you become a homeowner, maybe someone can help?\n\nLet’s take a theoretical situation with round numbers: suppose you buy a 500k chf home, providing 20% down payment of 100k, and taking 400k debt at the bank, at a 1% yearly interest rate, so 4k/year on interests alone. Government decides that locative value if 1k/month. Additionally, suppose you have a revenue of 80k/y, with marginal tax rate of 15%.\n\nDue to locative value, you are now taxed on a revenue of 80k + 12k, so you should pay an additional 1k8 taxes to the state. If you do not reimburse the debt, you continue to pay the 4k interests yearly to the bank, and your taxable income becomes 80 + 12 - 4 = 88k, and you pay instead an additional 1.2k taxes. Thanks to the 4k interests payed, you saved 600 in taxes…\n\nHence my question : I do not understand why people tell me not to reimburse a mortgage, arguing that interests payed counterbalance locative value in the taxable income. It seems to me that you pay a lot more in interests than you save in taxes. The interests are payed in full, while the augmentation in taxable income is taxed at the marginal rate. Did I misunderstood something maybe? Or is my argument here correct?\n\n(I did not take into account the debt amortization but I dont think it matters here?)\n\nThanks guys !!",

After you accumulate 140 hours of overtime in that compensation account thay will start pay you full 100% of overtime worked. The 140 hours will stay in that account unless you fill a form to request pay from the competition account which has to be approved by your manager. You can use the money for extra leave time or they will cash it out to you if you end your employment. I see it highly unfair. You work, you get paid. Why would company collect an interest on your money sitting in their bank instead me collecting interest on money I earned. Interesting is that I did have to make a appointment with the HR to actually explain everything how thet works because the company website doesn't have any information about it, even the request form can't be find in forms section.

Super simple, but honestly… I loved it and It made saving feel effortless\n\nThen they shut it down…🥲\nSo I decided to rebuild it for myself. 😈\n\nWhat I’ve built so far:\n\nEach evening, my iPhone runs a Shortcut that pulls the day’s Apple Pay transactions and saves them in a PDF or text format to my Dropbox.\n\nThen a Python script picks it up automatically:\n\t- Calculates the round-up for each transaction\n\t- Generates a Swiss QR-bill so I can transfer the total to my savings (which makes it compatible with other e-banking systems)\n\t- Sends me everything on Telegram (daily summary, amount saved, and a mini equity curve)\n\t- Logs it all to Google Sheets to track progress\n      - I « share » it into the PostFinance app and slide to validate (single manuel action) \n\nWhat I do with the savings (but you do you):\n\nEvery Friday, I send whatever I’ve saved that week to Yuh, where I invest small amounts.\nIt’s become a kind of habit and honestly, it feels good to save without pressure.\n\nWhat I’m thinking about next:\n\t- Making the QR-bill available via email as well (not just Telegram)\n\t- Building an Android-compatible flow\n\t- Finding a workaround to also catch regular card transactions, not just Apple Pay\n\t- Maybe… turning it into a real app or web tool if there’s genuine interest\n\nI’m sharing this because I’m genuinely curious:\n\t•\tWould you find something like this useful?\n\t•\tDo you also miss the E-piggy?\n\t•\tWould you be open to testing a first version?\n\n\nI didn’t build this to make money, just to bring back something I found meaningful. But if others want it too, I’d be happy to push it further. Of course im more than happy for any kind of feedback \n\nFor the devs, I’ll put it in open source after some cleaning.\n\nThanks for reading!\nGreetings from Geneva 🇨🇭\n",

      "title": "Need Advice – Scammed for 3,000 CHF via Ricardo.ch",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m reaching out to ask for advice regarding a serious issue where I was scammed out of 3,000 Swiss Francs.\n\nOver a month ago, I purchased a watch via Ricardo.ch from a seller who had over 20 positive reviews and a 100% rating. Based on this, and trusting the Ricardo platform itself, I transferred the money to the seller upfront — a big mistake, I now realize.\n\nSince the payment, I never received the watch. The seller has made multiple promises to either send the item or return the money, each time with new excuses. The latest excuse was that he finally sold the watch and would transfer the money the next day — of course, nothing happened.\n\nI’ve reported the issue to Ricardo customer support, who reviewed the profile and claim it doesn’t appear to be a scam — though in my view, it clearly is. I also filed a police report online, and received confirmation they received it, but I haven’t heard anything since. I understand these things take time, but it’s frustrating.\n\nI live in St. Gallen, while the seller is based in Lausanne, which might slow down the police process. Does anyone have experience with how long such investigations typically take in Switzerland, especially across cantons?\n\nI also contacted my legal insurance provider, who tried calling the seller several times to pressure him into sending the money — unsurprisingly, that didn’t work either. They’ve been somewhat vague about whether they can initiate civil proceedings before the police investigation concludes. When I asked directly, they kind of dodged the question and just repeated that the seller keeps promising repayment and that I should “remain patient.” Not very helpful.\n\nI’ve heard in some cases that legal insurance might also help recover damages — is this true? Or is that only under certain types of insurance?\n\nOne strange part of this situation: the scammer is still actively communicating with me via phone and email. He doesn’t disappear or ghost me, but keeps stalling with new excuses every few days. What could be the reason for this? Is it just to buy time? Could there be a legal loophole he’s trying to exploit, like trying to push past a deadline for charges?\n\nEven more concerning: a few days ago, I received an email from Ricardo.ch informing me that someone tried to hack my account, and it’s been temporarily locked. This makes me wonder if the scammer isn’t just after my 3,000 CHF — but also trying to access my email or bank info. I may be paranoid, but it’s a strange coincidence. I’ve since updated all my passwords and enabled two-factor authentication.\n\nSo finally — here are my main questions for anyone with legal or personal experience:\n\t1.\tHow long do such police investigations usually take, especially across cantons?\n\t2.\tWhat exactly can legal insurance help with in this kind of case? Can they initiate court proceedings on my behalf before a police outcome?\n\t3.\tWhy would a scammer stay in contact daily rather than disappear? Is there any legal strategy behind this?\n\t4.\tGiven I know the scammer’s supposed address (if the data is correct), is there anything more I can legally do to recover my money?\n\nAny advice, legal input, or shared experience would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for reading this and for any help you can offer.",

The intention of who the money was to be eventually given to was shared but not well enough, I figure. \nSo, the money remains there, I guess. \n\nSomewhere in a bank in Vinkeveen, Netherlands, there is a safety deposit box. The contents are unknown and the key was lost or forgotten. It was important enough to leave a note about it and the number of the box.\nI wonder. \n\nThere is a story here that at this point has an unfinished ending or maybe this is the ending. \nI am hopeful. \n\nWondering avenues to share to gain advice and direction.",

Receiver bank said they don‘t have anything in the timeline, sender bank in CH said they cannot give me more docs than my signed order (IBAN written down with hand from the employee), internal order and account statement (no IBAN on there).\n\nEverything was a bit unclear, because I did not really receive a proof of payment, so I went through all docs again and again. Today, I noticed that there was nothing shown from an EUR transfer, which I advised my old bank to do. Receiver bank cannot accept transfers in CHF, so it automatically got rejected and could not get returned because the bank acc doesn‘t exist anymore.\n\nI am sure that I told the employee that my receiver acc cannot accept CHF so they have to convert it first, but unfortunately don‘t have any proof. They want me to pay a fee now for ruther investigation (which is understandable, but still hurts).\n\nIs anyone familiar with the fees for such an investigation? Does anyone have a clue where the money could be „stuck“ now (is there a middleman acting in between the banks)?\n\nPlease don‘t just write BS down, only good answers from people who have experienced such an investigation or are from this field.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a young adult, healthy, and just starting to think seriously about my retirement planning. I’ve been reading about the Swiss 3rd pillar (3a), but I’m still quite confused about the differences between insurance-based and bank-based options.\n\nFrom what I understand:\n\n* **Insurance-based 3a** ties your savings to a life insurance product, sometimes with a guaranteed return, but often with less flexibility and higher costs.\n* **Bank-based 3a** (like VIAC, Frankly, etc.) offers more flexibility and potentially higher returns (especially with ETFs), but no insurance coverage.\n* **Fintech/digital 3a (like VIAC, Frankly, etc.)**: bank-based 3a products, but offered by digital platforms. Typically lower fees, higher equity exposure, and better transparency.\n\nFor someone in my situation — young, healthy, and with a long investment horizon — would you generally recommend going with a **bank-based 3a** or **Fintech/digital 3a** over the insurance option? Or are there solid reasons to go with insurance anyway?\n\nAlso, what’s your personal experience with digital providers of 3rd pillar (3a) like **VIAC, Frankly, or others**? Any pros/cons I should be aware of before committing with respect to the \"traditional\" banks?\n\nThanks in advance for your input — I’d love to hear your thoughts!",

Now for the second mortgage in case of indirect amortization, I understand that the amortizations are paid into a pledged pillar 3. Assuming the property appreciates and one's ownership reaches 1/3rd in the property, the pillar 3 can be freed again (i.e. the pledge is removed). So besides the pledge removal fees, the banks will NOT ask for the amount of money accumulated in the pillar 3 to be repaid to them. Am I correct?\n2. Related to the above question, I keep reading that I do not need to amortise the first mortgage. But how would this even work? Again assuming that the property keeps on increasing in value, my ownership will again keep on increasing - effectively meaning that I am repaying the first mortgage (similar to how the \"paid\" the second mortgage). Incase I want to be leveraged, how would I ensure that the first mortgage is not \"paid\"?\n\nBest,",

Fast forward to today: we were heading to Como via train and decided to check out Chiasso, tbh it felt like a movie! Sure, you expect a few customs officers at a border, but we saw men fully dressed in black with guns (three of them), and two police cars parked right outside the train station. We walked through the town and I swear every single corner had a uniformed officer. The crazy part was in front of the church three police cars. While we were sitting at a café, my friend even spotted an hidden police car tucked in a little alley near the Raiffeisen bank. That was our cue to leave 😂 I’ve crossed the border at Basel, Geneva, and St. Gallen before, but I’ve never seen this much police presence in any Swiss town, let alone such a tiny one. Also the locals seemed totally unbothered, like this is all completely normal.\nAnyone know what’s really going on there?",

The bank explained that someone must have used/stolen IBAN, card number and birthday info to install TWINT on his phone (even though TWINT was already installed/activated on the account owners phone to the same account)\nBy standard procedure an activation letter is then sent to the real account owner to scan a QR code in order to fully activate the app and release the full limits. Unfortunately a limit of CHF 500 can already be exploited before that.\n\nBut I do not understand how a second TWINT app can be activated for the same account but on a different device/different phone number. Even the website of raiffeisen states that a simultaneous use on two different devices is not possible. I did some quick test for my own account with my wifes phone as a second device but was not able to enable TWINT there.\n\nI want to protect myself from such risks, but it anyway seems rather low security if just IBAN, card number and birthday are sufficient to link the app too an account and to right away have an allowance to spend CHF 500.\n\nIs it really possible to have TWINT active on a second device, linked to the same account?\n\nBTW: police seemed to be quite chill about it … answered in a manner of „do you really expect that an investigation would yield results?“\n\n ",
